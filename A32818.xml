            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Have often thought of the <hi>Divine Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> in making <hi>the moſt neceſſary things plain and eaſie to us, and the things that are plain and eaſie moſt neceſſary.</hi> The enſuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe is a pregnant Instance of <hi>both,</hi> preſenting to thy view <hi>the moſt common and acknowledged Rule of Righteouſneſs,</hi> which yet I fear is more cuſtomarily <hi>worded</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:42669:3"/> up and down the Christian World, than <hi>duely weighed and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</hi> of. I am ſure the <hi>practice</hi> of it, according to <hi>its juſt extent,</hi> would prove an happy Inſtrument of the <hi>beſt and pureſt Reformation</hi> that ever yet the World was acquainted with, and <hi>one of the likelieſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients</hi> I can think upon for the <hi>healing</hi> of the ſad <hi>Breaches</hi> and <hi>Diviſions</hi> now among us. Did we all walk according to <hi>this Rule,</hi> wherein we profeſs to be <hi>agreed,</hi> we ſhould ſooner come to agree in <hi>thoſe things</hi> wherein we as yet <hi>differ.</hi> I will not here detain thee longer, than till I have conjured thee to read with <hi>heed and conſcience</hi> the following Pages; and then I doubt not but thou wilt meet with ſomewhat to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thee, that neither <hi>my</hi> Labour, nor <hi>thy own,</hi> hath been ſpent in
<pb facs="tcp:42669:3"/> vain: This Concluſion undoubtedly thou wilt make to thy ſelf, <hi>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more lovely and reaſonable than the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which preſcribes ſuch a Rule as this; and nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more inexcuſable than the Lives and Practices of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors who conform not to it.</hi> And when once thou hast made <hi>this fruitful Inference</hi> within thy own thoughts, I am content to leave thee unto <hi>thoſe Convictions,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a Converſation anſwerable, or to the ſevere and unavoidable <hi>checks and reproofs of thy own Mind,</hi> if thou do otherwiſe. It was the ſaying of <hi>Protagoras,</hi> and repeated again by <hi>Plato,</hi> That <hi>Man is the meaſure of all things.</hi> Thus in his <hi>Body</hi> he is the <hi>Meaſure of other Meaſures,</hi> the <hi>Inch,</hi> the <hi>Yard,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:42669:4"/> 
               <hi>Ell,</hi> the <hi>Pace,</hi> the <hi>Furlong,</hi> the <hi>Mile,</hi> being all meaſured at firſt from his <hi>Digit, Hand, Foot, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> &amp;c. But it holds no leſs as to his <hi>Soul</hi> likewiſe, in reference unto <hi>Morality:</hi> God hath made him <hi>the meaſure of his own Actions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others,</hi> and referr'd him to <hi>himſelf,</hi> as the <hi>Standard of his Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Method of the Book it ſelf will be ſufficient direction to thee in the reading of it to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; <hi>viz. Firſt,</hi> That thou <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this Rule aright. Secondly,</hi> That thou <hi>meditate well on the Equity of it. Thirdly,</hi> That thou <hi>apply it diſtinctly to the ſeveral Acts of thy Life.</hi> And that it may prevail the more effectually, <hi>Laſtly, Enforce it carefully upon thy ſelf by our Bleſſed Saviour's
<pb facs="tcp:42669:4"/> Argument</hi> annexed to it. Upon each of theſe Heads I have diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>faithfulneſs and plainneſs,</hi> and now recommend the <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of my Endeavours, and thy Peruſal, to <hi>his Bleſſing who alone giveth the Encreaſe.</hi>

               <p>But, before we can conſider the words entirely in themſelves, it muſt be noted, that the Illative Particle in the beginning <hi>[therefore]</hi> puts us in mind of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, making them plainly an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from ſomewhat that went before.

               <p n="1">(1.)

               <p>Now 'tis very uſeful for us to obſerve here, that this Rule, [As ye would men ſhould do unto you, likewiſe do ye alſo unto them] enforceth upon us true Chriſtian Charity, and that to our very enemies, the Rule being not [What others do to you,] but [What ye would others ſhould do to you;] of which more<note n="*" place="margin">Sect. 3.

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:42669:8"/>
               <p>Nevertheleſs it may well be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, whether S. <hi>Luke</hi>'s relation reſpects the ſame time with that of S. <hi>Matthew:</hi> (1.) Becauſe we find him not ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely mentioning our Bleſſed Saviours Sermon in the Mount; and (2.) Becauſe the words of this Precept are ſomewhat varied, and the later Clauſe, as well as the Particle of Inference, omitted. It may therefore be conjectured, that theſe two Evangeliſts have not reſpect to what was deliver'd at one and the ſame time, it being very likely, that as our Bleſſed Saviour did more than once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate the Precepts of Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon his Diſciples, ſo he might in like manner more than once deliver the ſum of them in this Golden and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Rule. Nor is it at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that S. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Inference in this ſeventh Chapter ſhould extend as far back as to the later end of the fifth Chapter, the other Chapter that comes between treating of other Subjects: And therefore,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) I ſhall rather chuſe to refer it to what is compriz'd in the foregoing Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this ſeventh Chapter.</p>
               <p>Two things there are eſpecially,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42669:8"/> which our Bleſſed Saviour inſtructs them about.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) He cautions them againſt raſh cenſures of others. <q>Judge not,<note place="margin">Ch. 7.1, 2, 3.</note> that you be not judged; for with what Judgment ye judge, ye ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and with what Meaſure you mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again. And why beholdeſt thou the mote that is in thy Brothers eye, but conſidereſt not the beam that is in thine own eye? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Whereto it may ſeem a concluſion not altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, <q>Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</q> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calls off their thoughts from others to themſelves; and in this concluſion he warns them to afford the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to others wherewith they ſerve themſelves: <hi>q. d.</hi> None of you are willing to be cenſured and judged raſhly of by other men; what therefore you would not have others do to you, do not ye offer unto them; and ſo judge them not without cauſe, cenſure them not unadviſedly. This I conceive to be good ſenſe; but cannot ſay, 'tis proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42669:9"/> meant and intended by our Bleſſed Saviour, or his Evangeliſt, in this Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. For,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Between that and the Text there follows another Diſcourſe, wherein our Bleſſed Saviour urgeth his Diſciples to the great Duty of Prayer, and confirms their hopes of receiving from God what they pray for, if not always in kind, at leaſt always for their good, from the 7 verſe to this 12. <q>Ask, ſaith he, and it ſhall be given you;<note place="margin">Ver. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you: for every one that ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, receiveth; and he that ſeeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened. Or what man is there of you, whom if his Son ask Bread, will he give him a Stone? or if he ask a Fiſh, will he give him a Serpent? If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how much more ſhall your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven give good things to them that ask him?— And now immediately upon this it is added, Therefore all things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>With this coherence then it may be conſidered by us, as a neceſſary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42669:9"/> to be carefully heeded and obſerved by us, that our Prayers to God may be effectual: As if he had ſaid more at large, You may be ſure of ſpeeding with God in your Prayers, if you be not your own hindrances: There will be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in his goodneſs, which is far beyond that of any earthly Parent to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The onely obſtacle will prove in your ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> if you are not rightly diſpoſed to receive good things from him; and therefore, that you may be thus rightly qualified for ſpeeding with God, <q>all things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo unto them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</q> Or, as ſome read it by an Hebraiſm, (of which<note n="*" place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) Whatſoever ye would to be done unto you, (even by God himſelf, as well as men) be ye prepared according to your power to do unto others.<note place="margin">Non ſolummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do nolite judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, ſed &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnia quaecun<expan>

               <p>Of both which I ſhall treat by Gods help in their order.</p>
               <p>I begin with the General and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Rule of Life, as it is here laid down.</p>
               <p>Wherein we may obſerve more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Regulatum</hi> or <hi>Regulandum;</hi> the Actions ruled or to be ruled hereby, <hi>viz.</hi> our own Actions, and our own Actions towards other men, <hi>i. e.</hi> our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42669:12"/> Neighbours: <hi>[Do ye even ſo to them.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Regulam,</hi> the Rule it ſelf; and that is, <hi>[All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you,—]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the former I have onely two or three things briefly to ſuggeſt.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) We are prone enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to other men, to overſee, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and appoint their Actions: We are generally willing enough they ſhould act by Rule towards us: But our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour here calls his Diſciples thoughts home to themſelves, and gives them every one the ſpecial charge of directing and managing their own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aright: <hi>Quae dicis aliis, dic tibi ipſi, ut audias.</hi> We are principally concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to regulate our own Actions: We are every one to amend our own ways, to ſweep before our own doors, as we are wont to ſpeak. And,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Actions here ruled are ſuch as concern our Neighbour, ſuch as have reſpect and reference to our Neighbour, <hi>i.e.</hi> to all other men with whom we live and converſe; for ſo we are taught in Holy Writ to reckon every man our Neighbour. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſignificantly puts <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.5.</note> He that loveth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42669:13"/> hath fulfilled the Law of loving his Neighbour. In our Actions towards one another we are not left without Law and Rule; we may not do as we liſt, as it ſeemeth good in our own eyes. Nay,</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Together with our outward Actions, our Will it ſelf is to be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Rule here preſcribed; for it muſt be always remembred, that the Laws of Chriſt are ſpiritual, and reach alſo to the inward man. —<hi>Scelus intra ſe tacitus qui cogitat ullum, facti crimen habet.</hi>— To will, covet, reſolve, and intend, is, in the account of our ſupreme Law-maker and Judge, to do. The Thoughts, Deſires, and Affections of our Souls (<hi>i. e.</hi> our inner man) are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and cenſured by him as our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: So that, what we may not do, we may not will to do, we may not deſign or reſolve to do, we may not approve or allow of, we may not joy or delight in.— But I proceed now to the later and principal Point, the Rule it ſelf whereby we are to ſquare both our Choice and Practice: <q>All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, even ſo do ye unto them.</q> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, even ſo in all things, as ye would
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42669:13"/> that men ſhould do unto you; or, as S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, likewiſe, in like manner do ye unto them.— This Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive plainly includes in it a ſevere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of doing that to others, which we would not they ſhould do unto us. So pious <hi>Tobit</hi> inſtructed his Son;<note place="margin">Tobit 4.15.

               <p>FIrſt, It is requiſite that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this Rule of ours aright, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liable unto ſome miſtakes, if we are not duly cautioned againſt them. In order therefore to the explaining of it, and that ſo as the meaneſt Capacity may truly comprehend it, I ſhall proceed,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Per remotionem,</hi> negatively, and by way of removal of thoſe falſe Rules which men are apt enough to ſubſtitute in the room of this. And,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Per poſitionem,</hi> to declare poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively what this Rule of ours imports, and what we are to obſerve in order to the right underſtanding of it.</p>
               <p>By the firſt I ſhall ſhew, what it is not; by the ſecond, what it is.</p>
               <p>Moſt men in the world obſerve either no Rule at all, or elſe ſome falſe and crooked Rules, in their Actions towards others: And therefore it will not be amiſs here to glance at ſome Particulars which are too frequently put in the room of the Preſcription in the Text.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Then the Rule is not thus laid down, [All things whatſoever other
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42669:24"/> men would have you do to them, let them do even ſo to you.] We are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling enough to hear of other mens du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as I before alſo intimated, even whilſt we moſt neglect our own. We are apt enough to exact our right of other men, whilſt we refuſe our ſelves to do what is right and juſt unto them. We are prone enough to ſay to others, Do as you would be done by; we like it very well in the practiſe of others; but the Law here runs not in that form, <hi>Quaecunque ſibi fieri voluerint</hi>— Let others do as they would be dealt withal: but it calls upon every one of us eſpecially to regulate our own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to mind our own duty. Much leſs is it,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) [All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, let them do unto you.] Our Wills and Pleaſures are not the rule and meaſure of other mens duties towards us. It doth not follow that other men do us wrong and injury nakedly becauſe they diſpleaſe and offend us, becauſe they do unto us what we would not have them. This indeed is more or leſs the corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of us all: We are too prone and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42669:25"/> willing to make our Wills and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the Law and Rule of other mens Actions; and every thing that offends us, that is contrary to our humour or fancy, is cenſured forthwith as unjuſt and unlawful in our Neighbours, upon the ſame account.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The Rule is not, [Do ye unto others all things whatſoever they would have done unto them.] Men are very apt to covet more than what is their ſhare, more than belongs to them: And were we bound to do unto every man as he wills and deſires, we ſhould quickly undo our ſelves, and turn all things into confuſion.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) The Rule is not, [All things whatſoever ye will, do ye unto others.] 'Tis not <hi>Omnia quaecunque vultis,</hi> and there a ſtop; follow the ſway of your own inclinations and luſts. That were to licenſe all manner of iniquity, and to ſet open ſuch a floodgate to ſin and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, as would quickly overwhelm and drown the World. <hi>Quod libet, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet.</hi> And,
<q>Sic volo ſic jubeo, ſtat pro ratione vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas,</q> will not be admitted of here. Our own
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42669:25"/> Will abſolutely is not the meaſure of our Actions towards others; but it is it ſelf to be ruled by ſomewhat elſe. An Action is not therefore juſt and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, becauſe we will it; but our Will muſt have ſome Reaſon or Rule to juſtifie its choice and determination by.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) The Rule is not, <hi>Omnia quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque poteſtis,</hi> [Do all that ye can to others,] all things that ye are able or have power to do, all things you have an opportunity to do. Power of it ſelf juſtifies nothing, but muſt be ever in conjunction with Juſtice and Goodneſs, that all the acts and effects of it may be warranted.

                  <hi>i. e.</hi> Thou ſhalt not return injuries, nor keep them in mind. The
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42669:29"/> Hebrew Doctors expound it to this purpoſe. To avenge, ſay they, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a good turn to one who hath former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied it to him; and to be mindful of a wrong, is to do a good turn to one who formerly would not do ſo much for him; but at the doing thereof, to upbraid with his former unkindneſs, in ſuch like words as theſe, I will not deal with thee as thou haſt dealt with me. And both, ſay they, were here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: And according to this explication their Law required them both to forgive and forget injuries.— Now look what was thus the mutual duty of the <hi>Jews each to other,</hi> our Bleſſed Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires from <hi>us to all men,</hi> having taught us to eſteem every man as our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whom we are to love as our ſelves.

                     <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.15.</note> that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among your ſelves, and to all men.</q> Thus had he learned Chriſt, having been inſtructed

                  <q>I ſay unto you, ſaith Chriſt, that ye reſiſt not evil, or that ye avenge not evil: But whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other alſo, (an expreſſion of patience) and if any man will ſue thee at the Law, and take away thy Coat, let him have thy Cloke alſo; and whoſoever ſhall compel thee to go with him a mile, go with him twain.</q> So far would Chriſt have his Diſciples from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Retaliation, that he enjoyns them patience under ſupportable and tolerable injuries (ſuch as thoſe here mentioned) if they cannot right them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without revenge, rather than to oppoſe violence to injuſtice.

               <p n="2">(2.) We may farther enlarge our conceptions by viewing together this Affirmative Precept, and the Negative
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42669:33"/> that is deducible from it, and (as hath been ſaid before) to be referr'd unto it: for every poſitive Precept includes a double Prohibition in it. (1.) Of the omiſſion of the duty required: And, (2.) Of the commiſſion of the contrary evil. Whoever commands the doing of any good, forbids at the ſame time the neglect of that good, and the evil oppoſite unto it. He that injoyns us to do well, doth as certainly bid us ceaſe to do evil, and includes withal ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more in his Injunctions, than if he had nakedly bid us ceaſe to do evil. A negative Religion only will not ſerve our turns; we muſt be alſo poſitively good: and yet ſo we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, without ceaſing firſt to be evil, this being the beginning of our wiſdom, <hi>ſtultitiâ caruiſſe.</hi> The poſitive Precept then is the more perfect and intire, as including both the Prohibition and Command in it ſelf: And thus we are to interpret the Rule of the Text, by ſupplying it with its Negative, that is, the advice of <hi>Tobit</hi> to young <hi>Tobias,</hi> 
                  <q>Do that to no man which thou hateſt; what thou wouldeſt not that men ſhould do unto thee, do not thou thy ſelf that unto them.</q>

               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:42669:34"/>(3.) To prevent all miſtakes and miſapplications of this Rule to Practice, there are two or three things farther to be noted by way of caution about it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) In the general we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that this Rule may never be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood or applied as to contradict or ſubvert any other of the more particular Laws and Appointments of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Quod tibi bonum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtari velles, idem debes ipſe alteri praeſtare in eiſdem cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiis, quoad fieri poteſt <hi>citra tertii alicujus injuriam.</hi> Quod malum tibi fieri nol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les à faciendo illud alteri ipſe debes abſtinere quoad fieri poteſt <hi>abſque tertii alicujus injuriâ. Dr. More Enchir. Eth.</hi> p. 22.</note> or the Order eſtabliſhed and approved by him. We are to conclude, that it is not at odds with any particular Laws of Charity and Juſtice, being indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned only for a brief and univerſal comprehenſion of them, and as a fence and ſecurity to them; that we tranſgreſs not at any time through inordinate love of our ſelves; but ſince we are every one preſumed to be hearty proſecutors of our intereſt and concerns, we make this our pattern, example, and ſquare in our dealings with others, as ſincerely to have reſpect unto their good as our own, that we have not a meaſure and a meaſure, unjuſt balances, one for our ſelves and another for our neighbours; it having been generally obſerved in the World,<note place="margin">Homo in ſe aliud fert, in alterum aliud cogitat. <hi>Labe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi>
                  </note> that men have one judgement for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and another for their neighbours,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42669:34"/> ſo as to condemn others at the ſame time, and in the ſame things, wherein they acquit and juſtifie themſelves; and deem that evil in others towards them, which they continually practice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards others; and that good in others towards them, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny continually unto others. To prevent now this undue bias of ſelf-love and ſelf-ſeeking, Chriſt requires us to uſe the ſame meaſure to others as to our ſelves, as ſincerely to love others as our ſelves, and do for them as we deſire they ſhould do for us: To ſell as we would buy: for,<note place="margin">Prov. 20.10.</note> 
                  <q>Divers weights and divers meaſures are both of them alike an abomination unto the Lord.</q> This now being the purpoſe of the Rule, to prevent or remove that grand prejudice which makes us ſwerve and decline from the particular Precepts of Order, Juſtice, and Charity towards our Neighbour, we cannot, we muſt not at any time ſo underſtand or apply it as to croſs and oppoſe any of thoſe Precepts.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Therefore when our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you,</hi> he muſt be underſtood only <hi>de voluntate

None in his right mind wiſheth to himſelf what is evil and inconvenient: we muſt not imagine that our Saviour refers us to our corrupted and vitiated Wills; but he ſuppoſeth them according to their natural and true ſtate and temper, not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42669:35"/> according to what they may prove by degeneracy, evil habits and cuſtoms; as they ſhould be, as they were made by God and appointed to be, and not as they are through our default and corruption; as they are in the beſt of men, and not in the worſt: for, <hi>ſpecimen naturae— capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum ex optimâ naturâ;</hi> and as Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> ſomewhere obſerves, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture often ſpeaks of things, not as they are corrupted, but as they ought to be.

He that ſubmits to ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pain and grief, in order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and continuance of a long health and pleaſure, doth certainly therein diſcover not an hatred, but a love of himſelf: And he that is willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſome temporal damage, yea, and the loſs of his own life, in order to an eternal and glorious happineſs, keeps moſt undeniably conſtant and true to this principle of ſelf-love. Whoever then is a lover, chuſer, and embracer of ſin, though ſet off with the greateſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward allurements and conveniences, is really an hater and wronger of himſelf: And whoever hates, abandons, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes his ſins, though never ſo much to his outward loſs and damage, is in truth a lover of himſelf. He that is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave his ſins, to be diſturbed in his ſins, to be reproved for his ſins, ſo far wants love to himſelf.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42669:42"/> in a courſe of ſinning, is in like manner ſo far wanting in a true love to himſelf: And he that loves not himſelf, is not yet prepared for doing unto others what he would have others do unto him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wills ſuch things from others, which are indeed prejudicial and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to himſelf.— Some there are who take pleaſure in the corrupting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching of each other, <hi>ſe invicem tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitudine illicitae voluptatis oblectare,</hi> as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaks;<note place="margin">De Civ.

Corrupted man may not thus reaſon, I deſire not my ſelf to be check'd for my ſins, and therefore I will not blame or reprove any others; I deſire my ſelf to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and accommodated with all means and opportunities for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my luſts, and therefore I will alſo farther others in the like; I love my

                  <note place="margin">Vide Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth in loc.</note> Some of the Jewiſh Writers, 'tis true, expound it to this purpoſe; That when one man ſinneth againſt another, he ſhould not inwardly hate him hereupon, but make it known to the Offender, and ſay, Why haſt thou done thus to me? tell him freely, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and roundly of it: And ſo 'tis much-what the ſame with that of our Bleſſed Saviour,<note place="margin">S. Luk. 17.3.</note> 
                  <q>If thy Brother ſin againſt thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.</q> But then others as warrantably take the words in a greater extent; He that ſeeth his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſin, ſaith <hi>Maimonides,</hi> or walk in a way not good, is commanded to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him to do better, and to certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, that he ſinneth againſt himſelf by his evil deeds, as it is written, <q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking thou ſhalt rebuke thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</q> which is the Original of this Law in <hi>Leviticus.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is noted to ſignifie, to rebuke with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42669:43"/> of argument, by words to ſhew what is right, and refel the contrary. But that which I chiefly obſerve here, is, that this is injoyned as an Office of Love to our Neighbour; <q>Thou ſhalt not hate thy neighbour in thy heart; thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him:</q> or, as it may be rendred, <q>leſt thou bear ſin for him,</q> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> become guilty of his ſin, and ſo partake of his puniſhment.— To keep others from ſin, is to keep them from doing the greateſt miſchief to themſelves, and ſo an undoubted office of the trueſt love: and on the other ſide, to ſollicite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons unto ſin, or to ſooth them up in their ſins, is to do them the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and ſo to hate them in our hearts. Thus therefore we may not do to others, though we ſhould vitiouſly covet that others ſhould do ſo unto us, becauſe this will of ours ariſeth not from a true love to our ſelves, but from a perverted love, a blind and miſtaken love, a love which is really and effectually the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hatred: Such a falſe love as this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth many, and is too common in the world.</p>

Enchirid. Mil. Chriſtiani,</hi> p. 135, 136.</note> diſcourſeth thus: —When a Youth is mad of a young Maid, that the common people call Love, when as there is not a truer hatred. True love conſults ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers benefit, though with his own loſs. But what doth this fond Youth look at, ſave his own pleaſure? He loves not her therefore, but himſelf: nay, he loves not indeed himſelf; for none can love another, unleſs he firſt love himſelf, and that aright: none can hate another, unleſs he firſt hate himſelf. But then to love well is ſometimes to hate well, and to hate well is to love well: Therefore he that for ſo ſmall an advantage by his flatteries and gifts lays ſnares for the Maid, that he may deprive her of that which is her beſt, to wit, her integrity, her modeſty, her ſimplicity, her good mind, her fame, does this man, think you, hate or love her? Certainly there can be no hatred more cruel than this. So when fooliſh Parents indulge their Childrens Vices, men ſay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, How tenderly do theſe Perſons
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42669:44"/> love their Children! But rather, how cruelly do they hate them, who whilſt they give way to their own affections, neglect their Childrens ſalvation? For what other thing doth our moſt envious enemy the Devil wiſh us, than that here ſinning with impunity, we ſhould fall into eternal puniſhment? Again, Men call him a gentle Maſter, and a merciful Prince, who either connives at, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours certain wickedneſſes, that they may ſin the more licentiouſly, being left without the dread of puniſhment. But what elſe doth the Lord threaten by his Prophet to thoſe whom he thinketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his mercy? <q>And I will not viſit upon your daughters, ſaith he, when they commit fornication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> And what did he promiſe to <hi>David?</hi> 
                  <q>I will viſit, ſaith he, with the rod their iniquities, and with ſtripes their ſins; but my mercy will I not take away from them.</q>— In Chriſt all things are made new, and the names of things are changed. He that loves himſelf amiſs, doth bear a deadly hatred to himſelf. He that miſplaceth his mercy is cruel. Well to take care of a mans ſelf, is to neglect himſelf. Well to hurt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42669:44"/> himſelf, is to profit himſelf. Well to deſtroy himſelf, is to preſerve himſelf. Thou wilt then ſhew a care to thy ſelf, if thou ſhalt contemn the deſires of the fleſh. Thou wilt do that man a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, whoſe vices thou ſhalt be cruel againſt; if thou ſhalt ſlay the ſinner, thou ſhalt ſave the man; if thou ſhalt deſtroy what Man hath done amiſs, thou ſhalt reſtore what God made.— Thus far <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> whoſe words I have tranſlated hither, as a pertinent illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of that pretended love which is ſo common among men, and that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and ſincere love to our ſelves, which the Rule I am ſpeaking of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth and is built upon.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) This Rule preſuppoſeth farther a continual converſe with our ſelves, a living in the daily exerciſe of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſelf-reflection, that we may not act towards others raſhly and unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, but upon a true underſtanding and compare of anothers condition with our own; that we may know what we ſhould expect from other men, and ſo what they in like manner may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly challenge and require of us. The Rule is wholly and altogether in vain,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42669:45"/> if men never give themſelves to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or live at ſuch a rate that they are indiſpoſed for the exerciſe of ſelf-refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. It is in vain, as I ſaid, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to any, that they would do unto others as they would others ſhould do unto them, if they never reflect upon their own thoughts and deſires, if they never take time impartially to ſuppoſe themſelves in anothers ſtate, and make anothers caſe their own. This Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption therefore of our Bleſſed Saviour ſuppoſeth men to live a ſober and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate life, in the free exerciſe of their reaſonable and deliberate thoughts; not ſo to immerſe themſelves in the cares of the world, or a multitude of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; not ſo to drown and beſot themſelves with ſenſual entertainments, to make their ſouls heavy with drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and exceſs; not ſo to tranſport themſelves with paſſion and luſt, as to indiſpoſe themſelves wholly for conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, or the unbyaſſed and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate application of it, for the ſquaring and direction of their actions. God having made us reaſonable Creatures, and written certain Laws of equity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tables of our Conſcience, expects
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42669:45"/> from us that we ſhould find time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect and conſider with our ſelves, and keep our ſelves in a temper capable of inferring from our own thoughts the Principles of our doings, that we may even of our ſelves judge that which is right: and we ſhall never act according to this Rule of doing as we would be done by, unleſs our thoughts continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hold a looking-glaſs before our eyes, or preſent a balance to our hands, for the due pondering and weighing of our own ſtate and condition and other mens together, that ſo our own ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſires and expectations from others, may regulate our actions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. This Law of Chriſt, you ſee, clearly preſuppoſeth much of ſelf-converſe, and ſuch a way of life as may diſpoſe us thereunto; that we never ſo devote our ſelves to any drudging Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, as to hinder the making of a pauſe now and then with our own thoughts; and that we lead not ſuch a brutiſh courſe, as to be left uncapable of conſideration to any good effect or purpoſe, never to underſtand what is fitting for our ſelves to deſire of others, never to mind and obſerve the caſe of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42669:46"/> others, or never to be like Men or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians affected therewith; like thoſe mentioned in the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos 6.1, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> 
                  <q>who are at eaſe in <hi>Sion,</hi> and ſecure in the Mountain of <hi>Samaria;</hi> who put far away the evil day, and cauſe the ſeat of violence to come near; that lie upon beds of ivory, and ſtretch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their couches, and eat lambs out of the flock, and calves out of the midſt of the ſtall; that chant to the ſound of the viol, and invent to themſelves inſtruments of muſick like <hi>David;</hi> that drink wine in bowls, and annoint themſelves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of <hi>Joſeph:</hi>
                  </q> That is, Who lay to heart no more the troubles of the Poſterity of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> than his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren did his in particular, when they caſt him into the Pit, and ſold him to the Merchants, never minding or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what became of him; but indulge themſelves in the mean while to all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of riot, even whilſt other of their Brethren languiſh under want and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Such perſons as theſe, who live in jollity, and ſpend their time in pleaſure, to the ſatisfaction of the fleſh,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42669:46"/> do uſually caſt off all thoughtfulneſs about others, who are in miſery and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity: that is, they never conſider the hardſhips and calamities that others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, and ſo what they would look for at others hands were they in their caſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe two are the more general Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions which the Rule of the Text buildeth upon, to wit, our natural and genuine love to our ſelves, and our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the due exerciſe of thoughtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and conſideration, ſelf-converſe and reflection, that we may know upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion what we ſhould reaſonably deſire of others for our ſelves.</p>

               <p>This ſincerity I am ſpeaking of, is not ſo much any ſingle Vertue, as the ground-work and life of all, without which they are not that they are taken for. Counterfeit Gold is not Gold:

               <p>But moſt certain it is, That all deceit and flattery and hypocriſie would ſoon vaniſh out of the world, did men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Golden Rule, to do to others as they ſhould chuſe to be done by; did they once love their Neighbour as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

               <p>Secondly, The ſame Rule reads us a Lecture of Humility, and gives a fair occaſion to declaim againſt Pride and Arrogance: For who is there that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and approves of the proud mans carriage towards himſelf? Who is there to whom high looks, inſolent anſwers, contemptuous neglects, a lofty and ſcornful carriage in other men, are not burthenſom and grievous? Who is there to whom the humanity, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and reſpect of the humble, is not grateful and acceptable? Pride is a moſt unſociable Vice: No man cares for bearing the proud man company. He muſt ſet Laws to all he converſeth with: He muſt be pleaſed, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and humoured, or 'tis impoſſible to preſerve quiet; and no man loves to be confin'd to ſo much obſervance. He can be content to abuſe and deride others, to make a mock and jeſt of them; but will not endure the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon himſelf. He will contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict every one, but none may gainſay him: And if any croſs or offend him, he becomes inexorable; nothing will ſuffice but revenge, and that in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42669:59"/> degree: A word miſplaced ſhall forfeit the mans life. Pride is made up of ſelf-admiration, and deſpiſing or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of others; an over-weening eſteem of a mans own excellency, and a ſupercilious undervaluing of others: And both theſe diſpoſitions are at great odds with that temper which is fitted for comfortable and delightful Society with other men. So far is every one in love with himſelf, that he cannot endure to be trodden under foot, nor will he patiently ſuffer another to inſult over him.

Then we may not wrong and injure the Soul of another: And that we do aither in the natural ſenſe, as often as we grieve and offend anothers mind, occaſion the trouble of his thoughts, and the diſquiet and diſcompoſure of his ſpirit, that ſorrow of heart, <q>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Prov. 15.13.</note> the ſpirit is broken;</q> or in the ſpiritual ſenſe, as often as we make others to ſin, whereby they wrong their own Souls in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, and hazard their eternal loſs and puniſhment.</p>
               <p>We muſt not, where we may avoid it, vex and diſturb the mind of our Neighbour, give our ſelves to croſs and diſpleaſe others; for we would not that others ſhould do ſo to us. Thus to do, is an apparent wrong and injury; for when once the mind is broken with grief, and vexed with diſquiet, the man is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to great temptations, and unfitted for the chearful ſerving of God, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of himſelf. 'Tis a chief part
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42669:64"/> of our happineſs to be at eaſe within our ſelves, contented and pleaſed in our own minds, tranquil and calm in our thoughts; and this we rob another of by wilful offences. 'Tis a deviliſh piece of malice and ſpite, of which we can give no tolerable account, to delight our ſelves in the affliction and trouble of anothers Soul. We are not willing others ſhould provoke us, we ſhould not therefore, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, "provoke one another.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.26.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But the chiefeſt ſort of Offences is, when we cauſe others to ſin: This is that ſcandal which the Holy Scripture denounceth ſo heavy and ſevere a Woe againſt the Authors of; <q>Wo be to that man by whom ſuch offences come!</q> Sin is indeed the greateſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Soul, the diſeaſe and the death of the Soul; the ſpiritual death and torment of that, which can never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo a natural death or deſtruction; the eternal undoing of that, which can never ceaſe to be. 'Tis ſin only which ſeparates the Soul from God the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Life and Happineſs: 'Tis ſin on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which breeds the Worm that dieth not, and kindles the Fire which cannot
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42669:64"/> be quenched: And therefore the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hatred we can ſhew to another, is to be a means either of his committing ſin, or continuing in it unrepented of, as I noted alſo before from <hi>Leviticus</hi> 19.17.</p>
               <p>True it is, in propriety of ſpeech we cannot make another man to ſin, we cannot force any man to ſin. Sin, as it is the greateſt wrong unto the Soul, ſo it is alſo at the ſinners choice, whether he will admit of it or no. <hi>Voluntas non cogitur:</hi> And ſo in this caſe, <hi>Nemo laedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur niſi à ſeipſo.</hi> Every ſinner ſtands ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for the injury he doth himſelf.</p>
               <p>But yet we may be capable of doing very much towards the determining of his choice, towards the tempting of him into ſin, or the encouraging of him in it: And whenever we do that willingly, upon the occaſion whereof our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is drawn and moved to conſent unto ſin, or continue in it, we are ſo far guilty of his ſin: We bring the guilt of anothers ſin, and of the wrong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding to him by it, ſo far upon our ſelves, as we are Authors or Acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; for here, as in caſe of High-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, both Principal and Acceſſary are deemed alike guilty. Now many are
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42669:65"/> the ways Divines reckon up, whereby we may become acceſſary to the ſins of others, reputed authors and occaſions of their ſins.</p>
               <p>If we are Superiours in Authority over them, by <hi>commanding</hi> them to ſin; by "decreeing of unrighteous Decrees,<note place="margin">Iſa. 10.1.</note> in the language of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> Thus was <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> guilty of the Peoples Idolatry,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.4, 5, 6.</note> by <q>commanding that a Golden Image ſhould be ſet up, and that all at the ſound of a Trumpet ſhould fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 22.18.</note>
                  </q> Thus was <hi>Saul</hi> guilty of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Prieſts, whom <hi>Doeg</hi> ſlew at his command.<note place="margin">3 Sam. 11.15.12.9.</note> Thus <hi>David</hi> of <hi>

               <p>But all men may become partakers, inſtruments, and means of others ſins,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42669:65"/> by <hi>counſelling, adviſing, provoking, urging, perſwading, alluring,</hi> or <hi>enticing</hi> them to ſin; by <hi>aſſiſting</hi> and <hi>helping</hi> them in their ſins; by giving their <hi>conſent</hi> and <hi>furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> by going before them with a bad <hi>example;</hi> by <hi>undue ſilence,</hi> and <hi>not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving</hi> men for ſin, as we have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; by <hi>commending</hi> and <hi>pleading</hi> for their ſin; by <hi>juſtifying</hi> of, or <hi>flattering</hi> them up in their ſin; by bringing up <hi>an evil report on the ways of Religion,</hi> and <hi>affrighting others from Goodneſs and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> by <hi>threats</hi> or <hi>reproaches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould be over-large in giving you particular Inſtances of all thoſe Heads and Methods whereby directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly we may become the cauſes of other mens ſins, of their profaneneſs and irreligion, of their drunkenneſs and uncleanneſs, of their Sacrilege and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, of their Schiſm and Diſorder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all thoſe ſins whereby our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Soul, as well as our own, may be eternally ruined.</p>
               <p>Yet how often, alas! do men offer this greateſt of wrongs and injuries to others, under pretence of Good-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Love, and Kindneſs?</p>
               <p>Nor will it boot any here to alledge,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42669:66"/> that they are willing others ſhould do as much by them. I have before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented this Exception; and they have certainly neither a right Judgment, nor a regular Will, nor any true love for themſelves, who profeſs themſelves willing to ſin, and unwilling to leave ſin, <hi>i. e.</hi> willing to damn themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) We may not wrong or injure the Body of our Neighbour; <hi>viz.</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Stripes or Wounds maiming of it, or hurting of its Senſes; by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to ſuch courſes as are prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to their Health and Strength; and in the higheſt degree of all, by Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that crying ſin of diſpatching our Neighbour by violent hands our ſelves, or the employment of bloody Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, or ſome more ſecret means and conveyances. Now in all theſe caſes we may take a true and impartial eſtimate of the wrong and injury accruing to another, by ſuppoſing our ſelves in his place, rank, and condition. We are here capable, to be ſure, of judging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptly; for we ſeldom fail in loving of our Bodies, or in valuing the injuries inflicted upon them. What a rate do we ſet upon our bodily health and eaſe?
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42669:66"/> upon any of our Limbs and Senſes? How much are we readily willing to part with, either to ſecure or to recover them? But then we ſtake all to ſave our Lives: <q>Skin for skin,<note place="margin">Job 2.4.</note> yea all that a man hath will he give for his life.</q>— Who is there willing to be put to pain himſelf? to loſe an Eye, an Hand, a Leg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> himſelf? to be mangled or murdered himſelf? And therefore in all theſe and the like caſes, we have a Principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us rebuking us for the wrongs of this nature which we offer to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and telling us plainly, that we ought not ſo to do.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We are farther inſtructed hence, not to wrong or injure another in his near Relations, which are indeed a part of himſelf; ſuppoſe the Husband or Wife of another, and the Children of another.</p>
               <p>Apparent wrong and injury is done to the Husband or Wife of another by Adultery, bringing of them thereby to the guilt of that horrid ſin of Perjury, and breach of their Marriage Vow and Covenant; taking away that which Husband or Wife concern'd do or ſhould eſteem moſt precious, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42669:67"/> Love and Faithfulneſs of each other; and it may be robbing of the right Heirs of their due by a Baſtard and unlawful Brood, the Children of the Adulterer or Adultereſs, beſides many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.</p>
               <p>Nor will it here excuſe the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Wife, that poſſibly her Husband might be conſenting; or the adulterous Husband, that his Wife poſſibly might yield thereto, and ſo they do no more than they are willing to ſuffer: for in this caſe their Wills are irregular: This their willing ſpeaks <hi>their corruption the more,</hi> but the <hi>wrong and injury no whit the leſs.</hi> No man diſpoſed as he ſhould be, is willing that another ſhould wrong him in aſſaulting the Chaſtity of his Wife: no man rherefore ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt anothers in that kind. No Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man diſpoſed as ſhe ſhould be, is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that another ſhould draw aſide her Husband to unlawful Embraces; and therefore ſhe ſhould not entice or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure or admit of the Husband of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Next, as to the Children of others, I will inſtance in two Particulars.</p>
               <p>The former reſpects thoſe who have
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42669:67"/> the care and charge of the Nurſing and Education of Children committed to them; they are to take great heed that they wrong not thoſe committed to their care, by denying or withholding from them any thing fit or convenient, Food or Lodging, Inſtruction, Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Encouragement; by negligence or indiſcretion. Theſe ſhould ask them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what care and conſcience they would deſire and expect in others to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their own Iſſue? and ſo deal with the Children of others left to them. Believe it, 'tis a great and conſiderable wrong, that is often done both to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Parents in thoſe Children, by the ignorance, or ſloth, or baſeneſs and diſhoneſty of Nurſes, Guardians, School-maſters, and others that over-look them in their Infancy and younger years, who are concerned in their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the forming of their Minds and Manners, or training them up to ſome Trade and way of Life.</p>
               <p>The later ſhall be of the Children of others grown up, and ripe for Marriage; I mean, the ſtealing or forcing away of ſuch, without the privity and conſent of their Parents. <hi>Muſculus</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42669:68"/> upon S. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel makes this very application of the Rule: 'Tis, ſaith he,<note place="margin">Muſcul. in S. Mat. c. 7. 12.</note> diſputed ſometimes about clandeſtine and ſtoln Marriages, ſuch, to wit, as are made without the knowledge and againſt the will of Parents, whether they be juſt and valid; and here ſome demand a clear word of God, whereby they are forbidden, and that out of the New Teſtament: for neither the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor the Law of <hi>Caeſar</hi> will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them. Now therefore, for their reſolution, <hi>interrogent illi ſeipſos, num velint ſibi tale quid fieri;</hi> Let them ask themſelves impartially, whether they would have any ſuch thing done to themſelves; whether they are willing their own Daughter ſhould be fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and againſt their liking, taken away by one whom they would by no means admit of for their Son-in-Law: <hi>Certè nequaquam hoc volunt;</hi> Aſſuredly, ſaith he, they would in no wiſe. Why therefore do they not ſee, according to our Saviours Rule, that it is unlawful for them to do ſo to others? Why do they not ſee that here is a Word of the Lord, a Law of the Lord, the ſum to wit of the Law and Prophets, whereby
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42669:68"/> ſuch a thing is forbidden? Is not this plain Scripture? Is not this the Word of God, which Chriſt here avoucheth to be the Law and the Prophets, That we ſhould do unto others as we would our ſelves in a like caſe be dealt with?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By the ſame Rule we muſt not wrong or injure our Neighbour in his Goods and Poſſeſſions, either openly by force, or covertly by fraud, being our ſelves unwilling to be ſo ſerved. We ſhould neither rob nor defraud our Neighbour,<note place="margin">Levit. 19.13.</note> if we obſerved this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. We all cenſure this wickedneſs in other men: we ſay to our Neighbour, "Thou ſhalt not ſteal; and give the name of <hi>Thief</hi> as an Epithet of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. <hi>Nathan</hi> therefore took this wiſe courſe with King <hi>David,</hi> to make him in the iſſue accuſe, condemn, and ſentence himſelf in the perſon of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe caſe he had firſt propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Parable:<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <q>There were two men, ſaith he, in one City, the one rich, and the other poor; the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds, but the poor man had nothing ſave a little Ew-lamb, which he had bought and nouriſhed up, and it grew
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42669:69"/> up together with him and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drink of his own cup, and lie in his boſom, and was unto him as a daughter: And there came a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to the rich man, and he ſpared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dreſs for the wayfaring man that was come to him, but took the poor mans Lamb, and dreſs'd it for the man that was come to him: Whereupon, ſaith the Text, <hi>David</hi>'s anger was greatly kindled againſt the man; and he ſaid unto <hi>Nathan,</hi> As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this thing is worthy to die, and he ſhall reſtore the Lamb four-fold, becauſe he did this thing, and becauſe he had no pity.</q> Now after this, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> needed no more to ſatisfie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>David</hi> of the wrong done in taking the Wife of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> than to wiſh him to ſuppoſe the caſe he had already judged his own: "Thou art the man, ſaith he,
<q>—mutato nomine,<note place="margin">Horat.</note> de te Fabula narratur.—</q> And <hi>David</hi> readily acknowledgeth upon it, "I have ſinned againſt the Lord. There cannot be a more effectual courſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42669:69"/> to make a true eſtimate of the evil of thoſe wrongs we do at any time to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, than thus to conſider of the caſe as repreſented to us in a Parable of other men, that we may in the iſſue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult apply the ſame Sentence unto our ſelves, which we ſhould readily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce upon a like offender.</p>
               <p>'Tis plain and evident, that thoſe malicious ſpirits, who delight in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and ſpite, who give themſelves to the prejudicing of their Neighbours without any regard to their own benefit, nay, and ſometimes to their own damage alſo, act not by this Rule I am ſpeaking of. He that lets his Cattel into his Neighbours Field of Corn, to ſpoil it, by devouring or trampling of it; He that ſets fire to his Neighbour's Houſe or Barn; He that wilfully hurts his Neighbours Beaſts or Goods, is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that another ſhould do ſo by him. Did men act as they would chuſe for themſelves, all theſe malicious wrongs, to be ſure, would ceaſe, yea, and all the oppreſſions, and cozenage, and uſurpations, and extortions in the World, which men are tempted to, in order, as they imagine, to ſome private

How high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do they reſent whatever ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon their Honour? And who would willingly forfeit the good thoughts and opinions of others, the good words and reports of others, the favour and friendſhip of others, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of his Place and Dignity?</p>
               <p>A mans Credit and Good Name is eminently valuable upon this account among others, becauſe it is the chiefeſt means of his doing good in the World. None much cares for that which comes from one of an ill Name: His counſel and advice is not regarded, his checks and reproofs little heeded. 'Tis no mean prejudice therefore, to thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially who are in any Publick Office of Truſt or Authority, to have their Good Names beſpattered or taken from them. And if once we eſteemed of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Credit as of our own, we ſhould be extremely wary of detracting from his Reputation, by any of thoſe ways of defamation which are too ordinary in the World.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhould not bear falſe witneſs
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42669:73"/> againſt him, if called thereunto. <q>A man that beareth falſe witneſs againſt his neighbour, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 25.18.</note> is a Maul, and a Sword, and a ſharp Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:</q> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> He doth him as much miſchief as if he ſtruck his Head with a Maul, wounded him with a Sword, or pierced his Heart with a ſharp Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Whom would it not grieve to have his Good Name, and Life, it may be, with it, taken from him by a ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or malicious Falſe-witneſs?</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſhould not ſlander and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite our abſent Neighbour by falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations and detractions: That is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar practice of too many, who are (as <hi>Plautus</hi> his Phraſe is) <hi>mures nominis alieni,</hi> as Mice to other mens Good Names, who do <hi>corrodere famam alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> nibble continually at, and take away from the Reputation of others. Sometimes they do this out of ill-will and revenge, ſometimes out of envy, ſometimes out of ambition to appear themſelves more beautiful, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting others as deformed; ſometimes out of vanity. At ſome times you ſhall have them publiſhing the private and ſecret faults of others, amplifying and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42669:74"/> aggravating of them with many a black circumſtance; and not contented, it may be, with doing once ſo, repeating the matter, and going over again and again with it. Sometimes they will do the feat more undiſcernedly, by Libels; which are not unfitly defined to be Lies with Bells added to them to ring them up and down the Countrey.<note place="margin">Lord <hi>Verulam.</hi>
                  </note> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they will preface the matter with ſome ſhews of ſorrow, and good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Party they are ſpeaking of; ſuch as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> thus deſcribes: You may obſerve, ſaith he, great ſighs intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Relation; the man ſpeaks <hi>tanquam contuſus &amp; cum quâdam tardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, dimiſſis ſuperciliis, voce plangenti,—</hi> as if he were confounded, and aſhamed of the matter, and loth to deliver it, making ſome ſtops, caſting down his eyes, with a mournful tone he tells you, <hi>Vehementèr doleo, quia vehementèr diligo,</hi> I am very ſorry for him, becauſe I very much love and honour him: <hi>Et ſic egreditur maledictio;</hi> ſo he prepares the way for his deſigned Reproaches, and makes them enter the deeper in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of thoſe that hear him. Sometimes you ſhall have them commending a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42669:74"/> with a ſpiteful <hi>But</hi> after it, which ſhall cut the throat of their Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and prove it to be nothing elſe but a politick cloak for their own mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs. Sometimes they will have a more ſecret conveyance ſtill, which yet ſhall be no leſs effectual to their Neighbours diſcredit, by whiſpering and tale-bearing, and inſinuating evil ſuſpicions and ſurmizes, firſt to one and then to another, concerning him. Theſe and the like are the common tricks of ſlandering tongues, wherewith they ſmite and wound their Neighbours Good Name, and thereby, as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt hath it, "cut like a ſharp Razour.<note place="margin">Pſal. 52.2.</note> But who would chuſe to be dealt with thus himſelf? to have all his ſecret lapſes and infirmities proclaimed abroad upon the houſe top, heightned and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated to the utmoſt? to have many tales and forgeries ſpoken of him behind his back; and the good he hath at any time done undervalued, perverſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, and miſrepreſented?</p>
               <p n="3">3. We ſhould not diſgrace our Neighbours to their faces, by contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and opprobrious ſpeeches, clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous out-cries, railing accuſations, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42669:75"/> expoſtulations before others, cruel mockings, taunts, and deriſions, laughing them to ſcorn, and ſhewing that we undervalue and ſlight them, (whether by words, or geſtures, or actions, it matters not) as if they were fools, or unworthy of any regard or honour from us. We cannot endure this practice in others towards our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We ſhould not countenance any who make it their imployment to go about with odd reports, and rumors, and whiſpers, to undermine the credit of other men; for in this caſe, as was intimated before, No Receivers, no Thieves. Were there none that had itching ears to hear with delight of other mens imperfections, faults, and miſcarriages, there would be fewer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of them, and we our ſelves, I am ſure, would not like that other men ſhould cheriſh and countenance any who ſo injure us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We ſhould not harbor evil ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizes and ſuſpicions of others, without cauſe; much leſs judge raſhly of them, and pronounce unadviſedly upon them, determine of their thoughts and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42669:75"/> which we know not; conſtrue doubtful matters to the worſt, without regard had of circumſtances; or be ready and forward to believe our ſelves, and hand down to others, every ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous accuſation we have at any time heard concerning them: For we would not have other men think evil of us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground or reaſon; we would not have them judge boldly and ſeverely of our thoughts and intentions; we would not have them make the worſt of all our actions; we would not have them believe every flying report con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us; we would not have them report with confidence what they chance to hear at any time of us, whereby our intereſt in others good opinions, our Good Name and Reputation may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaged. We are therefore in all theſe caſes indiſpenſibly obliged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame innocency towards other men.</p>
               <p>Were this Rule practiſed as it ought to be, there would be no prophane <hi>Chams,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 9.</note> taking pleaſure in the diſcloſing of their Fathers nakedneſs: There would be no blaſpheming <hi>Shimeis,</hi> railing at,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.</note> and curſing others to their face: There

                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 14.9.</note> to leſſen the worth and repute of others by Parables and Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Had this Rule been obſerved, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> for his Abſtinence had never been cenſured to have a melancholy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil within him;<note place="margin">S.

Luke 7.34.</note> to be a wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibber, and friend to Publicans and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:<note place="margin">Act. 28.4.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> had not been thought a murderer, becauſe the Viper cleaved to his hands; nor yet the ſuffering <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileans,</hi>

               <p>In a word, There cannot be a better protection againſt the injuries of a falſe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42669:76"/> or malicious Heart or Tongue, than this.</p>
               <p>And thus now I have declared the third Particular ſomewhat largely, that we are trained up by this Rule to an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Innocency towards others, not to do them any wrong or injury in any capacity, in their Perſons, Souls, and Bodies; in their Relations, in their Goods and Poſſeſſions, or in their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and Good Name. Thus he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth another as himſelf, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth to another as he would be done by himſelf, hath fulfill'd the Laws that require this Innocence from us: For, <q>this, ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 13.9, 10.</note> Thou ſhalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery, Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhalt not ſteal, Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs, Thou ſhalt not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet; and if there be any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, it is briefly comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this ſaying, namely, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf. Love worketh no ill unto his Neighbour; therefore Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, In caſe of wrong and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry done unto another (as who is there
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42669:77"/> that in all points, and at all times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves innocency?) this Rule enjoyns us to make, as we are able, Reſtitution or Reparation, Amends and Recompence for the wrong and injury we have done; for ſo we all deſire and expect that others ſhould do to us. Where the Party is diſabled to make a real ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there is yet a reparation due by humble and penitent confeſſions and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments: but where the Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution may be in kind or value, theſe alone will not ſuffice. <hi>Zacheus</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution is fit for our imitation, <q>If I have wronged any man by cozenage,<note place="margin">S. Luke 19.8.</note> forgery, and falſhood, I will reſtore four-fold;</q> at leaſt I will reſtore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what I have wronged him of. It were not difficult to ſhew, that there is no true repentance without this, and conſquently no forgiveneſs of the wrong and injury done, to be look'd for at Gods hand, according to S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>Non remittitur peccatum niſi reſtituatur ablatum:</hi> But the Motive I have now to urge is, becauſe every one looks and deſires that this reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be made unto himſelf, that there be a ſatisfaction and amends for the wrong
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42669:77"/> and injury done him; and this ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction muſt be according to the wrong done.</p>
               <p>If therefore thou have wronged thy Neighbours ſpirit by wilful vexation and grieving of him, thou art bound to make him the amends of an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, and the ſupplies of what comfort thou art able to adminiſter.— If thou have wronged his ſoul by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing him to ſin, or being a means of his continuance in ſin, thou art obliged to make him reparation according to thy power, by provoking him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and uſing all thoſe good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of inviting him to Vertue and Goodneſs, which are fitteſt to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ill methods and arts of ſinning thou haſt formerly preſcrib'd him.— If thou haſt prejudiced him in his Body, or any part or member thereof, thou art obliged to make him ſatisfaction ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the value of that loſs he hath thereby ſuſtained.—If thou haſt taken away his Goods, thou art obliged to reſtore them. — If the ſpoil of the Church, the Inheritance of Widows and Orphans, the Hire of Labourers be in thine hand, thou art obliged to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42669:78"/> part with it. — If thou haſt ſpread falſe reports of thy Neighbour, thou art bound to unſay them. — If thou haſt blaſted his reputation, thou art engaged to do what thou canſt to ſet him right again in the eſteem of others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that hath wronged and injured another, and makes him not ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the wrong done, declares that he is ſtill of the ſame diſpoſition, and likes and approves well enough of the wrong and injury that he hath done him. He that withholds any thing that is anothers from the right Owner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which he had unjuſtly gotten and procured from him, juſtifies himſelf in his unrighteous uſurpation and theft: and whoever doth any of theſe things, deals not with others as he is deſirous to be dealt with.</p>
               <p>Some injuries there are which admit not of a reſtitution, which cannot be undone again: Sometimes alſo the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender is utterly diſabled for making any competent and real ſatisfaction; and there the wrong doer ſtands obliged to a ſupply of confeſſions and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, repentance and godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Sometimes the perſon wronged
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42669:78"/> is not in being, and then the reſtitution is due to the Heirs of his Body and Fortunes, or, if he have none, to the common Heirs of every good mans Charity and Abundance, the Poor, I mean, and Indigent. But whoever he be that have wronged his Neighbour, is unqueſtionably engaged to make him ſome amends, by the profeſſion of his ſorrow for the injury done, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of doing ſo no more, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing to the reality of that good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion by a preſent return of what he hath unjuſtly taken away, and making reparations, as he is able, for the dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges another hath ſuſtained through his injuſtice.</p>
               <p>Innocence in the firſt place is to be preſerved, and no wrong done; but in caſe of a miſcarriage, there lies a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of repentance, reſtitution, compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and amends upon him that hath done the injury: for this is that which we every one deſire from others.</p>

               <head>SECT. X.</head>
               <p>FIfthly, This Rule obligeth us to a reſpective obedience and ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all our Superiours, becauſe this is the temper that we like, and wiſh, and commend in all that are under our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the great equality between us all by Nature, as we are Men, and by Grace, as we are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, before ſpoken of; we are yet by the Will and Providence of God, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the neceſſities and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of Society, ranked, diſpoſed, and ordered into ſeveral degrees and ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome above others. Order can never be in Families and Kingdoms, Church or State, without Government; and Government is in vain, and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible indeed, without Obedience and Subjection. Now this Vertue, which is ſo neceſſary to the well-being of the World, I am to recommend from the Rule diſcourſed on; &amp; the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to do it, I will briefly run through the ſeveral ſorts and degrees of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority and Authority which we are by
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42669:79"/> this Precept engaged in our ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be ſubmiſſive and obedient to. And,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) I begin with that which is firſt in Nature, the Authority of Parents over their Children. Many are the complaints and lamentations we have heard from Parents about the obſtinacy and rebellion of their Children. Many heart-breaking ſighs, many cutting thoughts, many tears of ſorrow have had this original. The moſt ungraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Children themſelves, when they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards live to become Parents, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and expect reverence and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the Fruit of their own Loins; loath, and execrate, and puniſh, what in them lies, the undutifulneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of their own Children, when they will not be ruled by them, when they refuſe their lawful Commands, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and rebel againſt their corrections, or diſpoſe of themſelves in the World without and againſt their conſent and liking. How many, otherwiſe dear enough in the eſtimation and affections of their Parents, have yet upon this laſt account only been abandoned and caſt off in utter diſpleaſure, ſo as never to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42669:80"/> be owned and regarded more, becauſe they took not their advice along with them, or made them not privy to their matching in the world? I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but the extremities and rigours of ſome Parents in this caſe may ſeem a little to intrench upon Humanity; but yet theſe are undeniable documents that every one approveth, wiſheth, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the obedience and ſubmiſſion of his Children in all reſpects. Let thoſe therefore who are Children remember their obligations unto this obedience, dutifulneſs, and ſubmiſſion to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; becauſe, if ever they live to be Parents, they would deſire the ſame from their Children: Let them be as dutiful, ſubmiſſive, and obedient to their Parents now, as were they Parents themſelves, they would wiſh their Children ſhould be to them. Hadſt thou Children thy ſelf, thou wouldeſt expect they ſhould go and come at thy bidding, they ſhould obſerve thy beck, they ſhould be awed with thy preſence, they ſhould humbly ask thy Bleſſing, and in caſe of a default they ſhould beg thy pardon, and kiſs the rod wherewith thou chaſtiſeſt their folly; that whilſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42669:80"/> they are at thy proviſion, they ſhould reſt contented with what Cloathing, Food, and Maintenance thou judgeſt to be fitteſt for them; and when they are entring themſelves into the World, they ſhould take thy conſent and counſel with them, in the choice of that way and courſe of life they deſign, or that Conſort they intend a Marriage with: and therefore thou art beyond diſpute concerned in theſe Particulars to give proof thy ſelf of thy obedience to thy Parents.</p>
               <p>The undutifulneſs of Children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Parents is oftentimes requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God in kind by the heavy Plague of undutiful Children.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) I will next inſtance in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Maſters over their Servants. What, I pray, is the good quality that every Maſter wiſheth and looketh for in his Servant, but Obedience? <hi>Servo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum hic contemptus maximus eſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Salvian, l. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>ſi non faciant quod jubetur:</hi> This is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt contempt Servants are capable of, not to do what is commanded them; for the very notion of a Servant ſpeaks dependence upon the will and pleaſure of another. Let Servants therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42669:81"/> themſelves a while in their Maſters place, and put the queſtion home to their own Conſcience, what kind of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants they would then wiſh to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſuch let them be to their own Maſters. This would ſpeak out to them as fully as the expreſs command of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.5, 6, 7.</note> 
                  <q>Servants, be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to them that are your Maſters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, with fear and trembling, in ſingleneſs of heart, as unto Chriſt: not with eye-ſervice, as men-pleaſers; but as the ſervants of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart, with good will doing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as to the Lord, and not to men.</q>— For who would allow of ſuch a Servant, the motions of whoſe labour, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and obedience kept pace and time only with his Maſters eye; whoſe duty and diligence are ruled wholly and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by his Maſters obſervance, who doth not his work out of love and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but fears more to be taken idle and negligent, than to be ſo indeed?— This would ſpeak out as much as the Exhortation S. <hi>Paul</hi> commiſſions <hi>Titus</hi> to give Servants,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.9, 10.</note> 
                  <q>That they be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their own Maſters, and pleaſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42669:81"/> them well in all things, not anſwering again, not purloining, but ſhewing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</q> — For who is there but abominates unfaithfulneſs, croſneſs, ſawcy replies and anſwering again in Servants; when in ſtead of doing their duty chearfully and conſcionably, they parly, and mutter, and debate upon the Commands given them, or echo back the laſt words of their Maſters Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Reproofs, as if they intended to fling them in his face again?</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Come we next to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Princes over their Subjects, and Magiſtrates over thoſe who are under their reſpective Juriſdictions; where indeed the caſe is ſo much the ſame as between Father and Children, Lord or Maſter and Servants, that both the ſame Names are communicated to them, and the ſame Commands interpreted of them.</p>
               <p>Could Subjects but once impartially ſuppoſe themſelves in the place of their Princes, having a charge from God to provide for the welfare and ſecurity of the People, and that charge clogg'd
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42669:82"/> with many difficulties in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, with many an interruption to their private eaſe and quiet, with many an hazard of their Life and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they would certainly learn to think the Obedience of Subjects highly reaſonable: and, whereas an upſtart Generation hath been very eager to ſnatch from their Prince all manner of Power about the ordering of Religion, they would queſtionleſs be of another mind.</p>
               <p>Religion is the chiefeſt Policy in order to a Kingdoms happineſs; Religion is the chiefeſt means of God's Honour in the World; Nothing moves men ſo violently as Religion doth: Nothing therefore can do more harm and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief than falſe perſwaſions about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, falſe Doctrines ſpread abroad un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour and pretence of Religion. How then can any Prince give account of himſelf to God, whoſe Miniſter he is in the World; or how can he ſecure the Honour of God, and the Intereſt of his People, yea the Crown upon his own Head, where the Power of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding and forbidding in Matters of Religion is denied him, or taken from
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42669:82"/> him? Certainly no conſidering Subject would be willing to this, were he in his Princes place. What good Parent would not take it ill to be abridged of the Power of Religiouſly Educating his own Children? What good Maſter would not take it ill to be reſtrained from this in his Family? And yet the furious Zealot will deprive his Prince of that poor degree of Authority, which himſelf is willing to uſurp as a Father or Maſter, nay, it may be, where him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is neither Father nor Maſter, in his Princes Dominions. The conſcientious Rebel (ſuch I mean who pleads Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for his Obſtinacy and Rebellion) labours to ſalve all by the diſtinction of Civil and Religious Obedience: Obey his Prince he will in Civil Matters, (though here too ſometimes 'twere well if he were more civil in his Obedience) but in the Matters of Religion, ſaith he, what hath the Prince to do to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? Every one muſt follow the light of his own Conſcience. A moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Principle, that tends to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining and ſubverſion of all Order in Societies. And 'tis very obſervable, that the moſt eager Aſſerters of this
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42669:83"/> univerſal and unbridled Liberty to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Spirits in Matters of Religion, whenſoever themſelves have mounted into Authority, have ſeen a plain neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of curbing and reſtraining it by Laws and Power.</p>
               <p>If then Subjects were once diſpoſed to do to their Princes as themſelves, were they in their room and ſtead, would deſire to be done unto, they would queſtionleſs approve themſelves moſt ready and dutiful, not only in Civil Obedience, as 'tis call'd, to the expence both of their Blood and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes for the Publick welfare, upon their Princes commands; but in a Religious Obedience alſo, welcoming and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Publick Orders for God's Worſhip and Honour, which are not plainly contrary to ſome Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they would ſtick at the doing nothing enjoyned them, but that the doing whereof were apparently ſinful, the tranſgreſſion of ſome known Law of God: and were the matter it ſelf doubtful, they would judge it equal for the weight of Publick Authority to turn the Scale; they would determine, that in ſuch matters where they muſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42669:83"/> venture to err on the one ſide or on the other, 'twere beſt for them to take the ſurer ſide; that ſide, I mean, which, beſides the equality and probability of Reaſons to counterbalance ſuch as are laid againſt them, hath the overweight of Authority, requiring Obedience, by vertue of God's general Command, in all things that are not manifeſtly ſinful: For certainly the Publick Peace and Quiet cannot be upheld and provided for with a more limiting determination.</p>
               <p>The ſame Rule obligeth inferior Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to be as truly obedient to the Supreme, as they expect the meaneſt Subject ſhould be to them. Inferior Magiſtrates ſtand in a double capacity, the one of Governours, the other of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Governours they are, according to the extent of Power communicated to them over thoſe that are under their Charge and Juriſdiction: but Subjects they are themſelves ſtill, in reference to the Higher Powers by whom they were ſent, and from whom they receive their Commiſſion and Authority. 'Tis in an Army no leſs a Crime for any Officers to oppoſe and diſobey their General, than for Common Souldiers to oppoſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42669:84"/> and diſobey their reſpective Officers; and 'tis no leſs a Crime for the General himſelf to oppoſe and diſobey his Prince, from whom he hath his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, than for any of his Officers to oppoſe and diſobey him: Nay, the crime of diſobedience is ſtill the higher, according to the eminency of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority diſobeyed and oppoſed. And the truth is, that which aggravates the contempt ſhewn to the meaneſt Officer in a Kingdom, is the violation of ſome or other degree of Authority commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from the higheſt, though through divers hands, unto him. There is no man but expects as much to be obeyed himſelf by the Officers whom he commiſſions and employs, as they can do by any over whom ſome meaſure of Authority is delegated to them. A Noble-man juſtly looks for as true ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance from the Steward of his Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, as he doth from the meaneſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant under him.</p>
               <p>Were this Leſſon therefore of doing as we would be done by, inwardly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, there would be no danger at all of the Rebellion of Subordinate Powers againſt the Supreme and Sovereign, nor
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42669:84"/> indeed of any Subjects againſt the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Powers ſent and placed by the Supreme over them.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) My next inſtance ſhall be in the Authority of Prieſts and Miniſters over their People, Spiritual Paſtors over their Flocks, the Congregations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their care, inſpection, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And here I will not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with that ſhare of Authority which is derived purely from the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to them; wherein yet they are as dutifully to be obeyed, as any other Officers commiſſioned and employed by the Prince: but with that ſpiritual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which is due unto them, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their ſpiritual Authority derived from Chriſt himſelf. Such as that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> commends in his <hi>Corinthians</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Titus,</hi> and which endeared <hi>Titus</hi> his affections unto them:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.15.</note>

               <p>But 'tis well replied here,<note place="margin">Vide D.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42669:88"/> Companion, yet were it not the ſafeſt way to tell him that he lied, when he charged him to obey him in the King's Name, nor to make a ſcoff of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or to reply he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he had any, becauſe he might abuſe himſelf and it at other times: If ſo he do at this time, he may anſwer it before his Betters hereafter; but in the mean while it were beſt for the Party commanded to obey him, till he be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he did either feign Authority where he had none, or elſe abuſe it in this particular. And if Officers ſhould not be obeyed in the King's Name, until men ſought out the truth, whether they had a lawful Commiſſion, or but a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit one; or whether they did not exceed and go beyond their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the King's Majeſty would want a great deal of neceſſary Service, and the Common-weal be at an ill paſs for the continuance of Publick Peace.</p>
               <p>Now, as my Author excellently adds, did moſt men fear God as much as men, or the Son of Man, the Judge of quick and dead, as much as earthly Judges, they would not ſo often withdraw their neck from the yoke of Chriſtian Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42669:88"/> (being charged to undertake it in Chriſts Name, and as they will anſwer it at that dreadful day) upon ſuch ſilly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions as they do. Be the Miniſter as they liſt to make him for his life, it hath pleaſed God to make him his Meſſenger, his Officer to demand Obedience of them; and ſhall it ſerve their turn to ſay, We will not believe that God ſent him with this Meſſage; or ſure he goes beyond his Commiſſion; when they know nothing to the contrary, but only will take occaſion from his Perſon to diſcredit his Doctrine, if it controul them in the purſuit of worldly affairs, or croſs and gainſay their humours and pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Thou replieſt, it may be, thou ſeeſt no evidence that Chriſt commands thee. But doſt thou abſolutely and infallibly know that he doth not call thee at this time to try thy Obedience in this particular? If not, how wilt thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thy Judge, when thou ſhalt appear before him, why thou out of the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs of thy heart didſt more reſpect thy private gain or humour, than his heavieſt diſpleaſure? Should thy anſwer ſtand for good, when thou ſhalt ſay to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42669:89"/> his Meſſenger, 'tis more than I know that Chriſt commands me, then ſhould the damned be juſtified at the day of Judgment, when they ſhall truly reply, they knew not that ever Chriſt did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate to them <hi>ſub formâ pauperis,</hi> 
                  <q>Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungred, or a thirſt, or a ſtranger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Moſt of them queſtionleſs had leſs probabilities to believe this in their life time, then thou haſt now to perſwade thee of this particular: For thou mighteſt have known that God had commanded thee by thy Paſtor, unleſs thy bad deſires and corrupt affections had made thee blind. But neither ſhall theirs nor thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance herein help; for ignorance, which is bred of bad deſires, corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or greedy appetites, brings forth hardneſs of heart and infidelity; ſo that <q>ſeeing thou ſhalt not ſee, and hearing thou ſhalt not hear,</q> nor underſtand the warnings for thy peace, becauſe thou haſt formerly ſhut thine ears at thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor's Admonitions, or raged at his juſt Reproof; and the Law of God binds thy Soul, upon greater penalties and better hopes than all the Laws in the World beſide could bind thy Body
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42669:89"/> (even upon the hope of everlaſting life, and the penalty of everlaſting death) to lay aſide all carnal ſelf-love, and all worldly deſires, for the finding out of the true ſenſe and meaning of it, as well as to obey it when thou haſt known it; and when any point of Doctrine or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in general or particular is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to thee by thy Paſtor, God's Word doth bind thee to ſearch with all ſobriety and modeſty the truth and force of all the motives and inducements which he ſhall ſuggeſt unto thee, all private reſpect laid aſide, leſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a partial Judge of evil thoughts: and if thou canſt not find better Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, it binds thee to rely upon his Authority, and that ſo much the more, as thou haſt more perſwaſion of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and ſincerity alſo.</p>
               <p>I have digreſſed the rather in this point, becauſe I look on this as a chief and principal reaſon why we ſo much beat the air, why the Labourers in Gods Harveſt do gather the wind, why <hi>Paul</hi> doth plant and <hi>Apollo</hi> water to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>viz.</hi> We are not believed and received as the Stewards and Diſpenſers of the Myſteries of God, as the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42669:90"/> and Embaſſadors of God, ſent and appointed by him to teach his Will and preſs his Commands, to reprove, and admoniſh, and exhort in his Name. No more is allowed to a Miniſter by the generality of People, than what they would to a ſtranger, to any inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon in the World, who ought to be believed and obſerved by them, in whatever carries the expreſs face and ſtamp of a Divine Command viſible in its Countenance.</p>
               <p>But that whereby I am to preſs this Obedience here, is the Rule of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour. Were you in our ſtead, had you, as we have, the care of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, informing, and admoniſhing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers committed to you; did you watch for their ſouls, as they that muſt give account; were you appointed the Miniſters and Vicars of Chriſt among them, you would certainly expect they ſhould reverence your Authority, they ſhould hearken obediently to your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, they ſhould never dare to reject or ſlight it, but upon clear evidence to the contrary; they ſhould ſet themſelves about the doing thoſe good things in particular, which in the Name of God
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42669:90"/> you recommend to them in order to their eternal Good, and decline thoſe evil and vicious courſes in particular, which you reprove them for, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them to leave and forſake. You would not take it well, that ignorant Perſons ſhould give you the lie in Points whereof they are no capable Judges. 'Tis true both of Scholars and Chriſtians, <hi>Oportet diſcentem credere,</hi> Learners muſt at firſt believe and receive on truſt what is delivered to them, till they are able themſelves to gainſay upon knowledge, and evince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. What School-maſter would not ſeverely rebuke and chaſtiſe the ſawci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Child who ſhould oppoſe the Rules he underſtands not, in ſtead of receiving and admitting of them on his Teachers Authority? What Pilot would not condemn and chide thoſe pragmatique Paſſengers, who having themſelves no skill in Wind and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in Stars or Compaſs, ſhould yet boldly intrude into his place, and teach him how to ſteer the Ship.</p>
               <p>Men do not certainly as themſelves would be done by were they in their Miniſters ſtead, when in a doubtful and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42669:91"/> ambiguous matter, which themſelves are not able to examine or look into, his Authority may not determine, or at leaſt move them to an impartial weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Arguments, and Motives, and Conſiderations which in Gods Name he propounds to them; when his Reproofs and Counſels can find no entrance; when they will not ſo much as draw near to the place appointed for their inſtruction by him, or if they are there, trifle away their time in other matters than a diligent attention to what is ſpoken to them by the Meſſenger and Embaſſador of the Living God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 25.12.</note>
                  <q>As an ear-ring of gold, and an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of fine gold, ſo is a wiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover upon an obedient ear,</q> ſaith <hi>Solomon:</hi> But 'tis the diſobedient ear that renders all Reproofs impertinent and miſplaced, makes them loſe their grace and efficacy.</p>
               <p>Why do we preach, if not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and obeyed by our Hearers? And wo is to us if we preach ſuch things as are not fit to be believed and obeyed by you. But obeyed we cannot be, unleſs we are firſt believed, and believed we cannot be underſtandingly, unleſs we
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42669:91"/> are firſt heard and attended to. So then you muſt give proof of your Obedience, firſt by coming to Gods Houſe, where you may be inſtructed; and when you are there, by reverent attending on the Teacher, and not rejecting what he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to you from God, without full and clear evidence to the contrary; and when you are gone home, by an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial examination of that which ſeemed at the hearing of it moſt doubtful to you, and a practice according to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever goodneſs you have been perſwaded and directed to. And all this is no more than what is moſt juſt and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in order to your own good and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, a due you owe to the Authority of your Miniſters Place and Office, and what, if you could once ſuppoſe your ſelves but in his room and ſtead, you would judge moſt fitting to be done.</p>
               <p>Were the Miniſters of God obeyed and reverenced by us, as by vertue of this Rule they ought to be, the diſorders and exorbitances of private ſpirits would ſoon be reduced to an humble compliance with all good, uſeful, or innocent Appointments; and the higheſt Cenſures of the Church would ſtrike
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42669:92"/> more dread on People than they now do: Men would be afraid of being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced by the Miniſters of Chriſt as cut off from the Communion of Saints, and ſo all viſible Title unto Heaven.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) I will inſtance a little in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority and preeminence of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent above the Younger, according to that Law of God given to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 
                  <q>Thou ſhalt riſe up before the hoary head,<note place="margin">Levit. 19.32.</note> and honour the face of the old man.</q> Theſe are in a ſpecial manner the Image of God, as he is the Ancient of Days; their long life hath learnt them much experience, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is the way to wiſdom: <q>There is wiſdom with the Ancient,<note place="margin">Job 12.12.</note> and in multitude of years is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:</q> And therefore ſome vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the ſigns and tokens of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, are a natural due to old men.

There is no aged perſon but thinks he deſerves ſome
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42669:92"/> reverence from the younger; we our ſelves, when we come to be old, ſhall expect as much, and therefore moſt ſhameful 'tis we ſhould need to learn this piece of good manners: But moſt of all abominable, that any ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and mock at the ordinary infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which attend upon Age, eſpecially in their own Parents. 'Tis extremely unworthy, when they will not give the Ancient leave to ſpeak, or ſport at their uſeful Admonitions, till they come by years to ſee their own folly; but more odious ſtill, when they revile them for the weakneſſes incident to their Age; and moſt inhumane and barbarous, when they will not bear and relieve, as they are able, the infirmities of thoſe aged Parents who brought them into the World, pitied and provided for them when they were weak and unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themſelves, and gave, it may be, that Staff out of their hands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are at laſt, in the decay of their Age, beaten themſelves.</p>
               <p>Whoever they are that deal thus with the Ancient, may look themſelves hereafter to be ſo dealt with by Youth of an inſolent and rude behaviour; and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42669:93"/> then they will remember ſadly this wickedneſs of their youth; this ſin of their youth will take hold of them. <q>Hearken to thy Father that begat thee,<note place="margin">Prov. 23.22.</note> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> and deſpiſe not thy Mother when ſhe is old.</q> This we ſhould learn of our ſelves, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what we our ſelves, after ſo long a life in the World, ſhould expect from Youth, our own Children more eſpecially.</p>
               <p>But whilſt I ſpeak of this, what muſt we conclude of ſuch Novelliſts both in Church and State, who deſpiſe and diſparage, oppoſe and riſe up againſt whatever Conſtitutions the Wiſdom of the Ancients have made, for Decency and Order, Peace and Devotion, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of Piety, and the ſecurity of the Common Welfare and Happineſs? This is Pride notorious, and beyond all Appology.</p>
               <p>I might proceed farther to urge the reſpect of reverence which we owe to any others that are above us in the gifts of Mind, or the outward good things and Riches of the World; but it ſhall ſuffice to have inſtanced thus far, by way of declaration of the fifth Particular.</p>

               <p>SIxthly, The ſame Rule obligeth us to all the poſitive Acts of Juſtice towards others ſince we deſire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that others ſhould be ſo juſt to us.</p>
               <p>The Negative part of Juſtice, <hi>i. e.</hi> To do no wrong or injury unto any, hath been already ſpoken to under the notion of Innocency. The Poſitive Acts of it come here to be conſidered of, whereby we do <hi>ſuum cuique tribuere,</hi> render unto others that which is right and due; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.7, 8.</note> 
                  <q>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, cuſtom to whom cuſtom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour; owe no man any thing, but to love one another.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I will inſtance,</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the diſtributive part of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that which concerns chiefly ſuch as are in Authority and Eminency over others, in the diſtribution of Rewards and Puniſhments where they are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) This Rule will train them up to the Rewarding part of Juſtice. 'Tis the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42669:94"/> great defect in Diſtributive Juſtice,<note place="margin">Charron of Wiſdom, p. 399.</note> as it is commonly practiced in the World, that it puniſheth only, and rewardeth not: 'Tis lame of this Right hand, and enclineth only to Puniſhment. The greateſt favour men uſually receive from it is Indemnity, a Pay too ſhort for them that deſerve well. But this is that which every one naturally deſires and expects, that his good works to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Publick, his uſefulneſs and ſubſerviency to the Common Good, be anſwerably acknowledged and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Gratitude is an undoubted branch of Juſtice; and <hi>Seneca</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> brands the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Vice for intolerable and unſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <hi>Grave vitium intolerabile, quod diſſociat homines.</hi> Now men in Place and Authority are the Diſpenſers of the Publick Thanks and Gratitude for Good offices and Deſerts, and therefore ſtand obliged accordingly to diſtribute Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Rewards for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Well-doers. There is none that deſerveth well, but, though he act not purpoſely and only for Reward, and can be content to do well though he miſs of it, yet he reaſonably hopes and expects ſome grateful return pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42669:94"/> to the degrees of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) This Rule leads alſo to the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing part of Juſtice, when there is need for it. At the firſt view indeed it may ſeem otherwiſe; for what Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor is there who deſires to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who would be puniſhed if he could help it? And therefore one would think, if the Judge dealt by him as he would be done by himſelf in his caſe, he ſhould ſpare and acquit him, in ſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning and puniſhing of him. But here we muſt call to mind what was premiſed in the explication of our Rule, to wit, that we are to underſtand it of no other Will but that which is regular and well-ordered, and complies with the Dictates of religious and ſober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Now if the deſires and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Malefactor were ſuch, he could not but will the Corrections and Puniſhments which are for his own amendment, or for the Publick good, the warning and ſafety of others. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive Juſtice is really a Branch of Goodneſs, aiming at the Offenders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation where the caſe will allow it, and the Common Good, to caution
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42669:95"/> and terrifie others from imitating ſo bad an example, leſt they ſhare in the like ſhame and puniſhment. It may be ſo, I confeſs, that the Common Good may prove inconſiſtent with the Private and Particular Good of the Offender. A Murderer or Traytor, for inſtance, that hath forfeited his Life to Juſtice; the Common Good requires that Juſtice ſmite him with her Sword; his Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Good, that he have a longer time of Repentance vouchſafed him; and were the Judge in his caſe, he would no queſtion wiſh the later for himſelf. What therefore muſt he do here? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, What he can, to promote the real good and repentance of the Offender; but yet the Common Good is far more valuable and deſirable than any Private and Particular Intereſt; and Publick Perſons, men in Authority, are to look on themſelves as Repreſentatives of the Society, whoſe Good they are to ſerve, and muſt conſequently do for it whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhould reaſonably expect to be done for their own ſecurity. Now 'tis unqueſtionably for the good and benefit of the whole Community, that inſolent, ſtubborn, and notorious Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42669:95"/> be put to open ſhame and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. A private and perſonal pity in this caſe is the publick wrong and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. Magiſtrates therefore are not to weigh ſo much what they would deſire themſelves were they in the Offender's room, as what they ſhould reaſonably deſire and expect, were they in the place of the whole Community and Society whoſe good their Office is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſerve. He that ſpares a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Offender, gives him liberty to do more wrong and injury, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanceth many to follow his example, in hopes of the like impunity, to the great prejudice of the common welfare. He that ſpares a Murderer, entails Gods Curſe upon the Land; and he that ſpares a Traytor, winks at a notorious Murderer, and declares but little value for the Publick Safety, bound up in the Life and Welfare of a King or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.— But then, beſides this, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of Juſtice is the beſt means to ſecure the common practice of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Rule, which hath ſo great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Publick welfare; and 'tis the Magiſtrates charge and duty, in order to the Common Good, to teach
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42669:96"/> Offenders, who have certainly broken the Rule by doing wrong and injury, how ill they have done, by making them to ſuffer and ſmart for it, and ſo to warn others not to follow them in ſo doing. As no body therefore is willing to be wronged, ſo he is to diſcipline others not to be willing to do wrong, by inflicting thoſe Puniſhments which the Offender is as unwilling to undergo, as the Party offended was to ſuffer the wrong done. It were better, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, for Offenders, if ſuch Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Corrections were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly inflicted, whereby they might be brought in time to repentance and amendment; and 'twere better for the whole Community, if the punitive acts of Juſtice were more impartially applied than they are. Certainly, could a Child chuſe reaſonably, he would rather ask the wholeſom ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Diſcipline from his Parents, than a fond indulgence of that Liberty which is like to prove his bane and undoing: And therefore when Children are grown up to years of maturity and underſtanding, they find reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow thanks both on their Parents and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42669:96"/> Maſters for this part of Nurture as well as any other. And there is as little que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but, would Maſtiſtrates, and thoſe who are in Authority, liſten to the cry of the Community, to the cry of Church and State, they would be more vigilant and diligent in the inflicting of puniſhment upon the Tranſgreſſors of the Laws than they are, for the ſecurity and promotion of the Common Good and Welfare.— I proceed,</p>
               <p>Secondly, to the Commutative part of Juſtice; thoſe Offices, I mean, which concern Commutations, Contracts, and Agreements, with the like Inſtruments of Humane Converſe. And here I will declare in like manner by Inſtances how the ſeveral Branches of Juſtice are deducible from the Rule before us. And,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) 'Tis a common due we owe to all men with whom we are linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Society, to ſpeak the truth; <q>Putting away lying,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.25.</note> to ſpeak every man truth with his Neighbour,</q> as the Apoſtle hath it. Speech is the Key which unlocks and opens our Minds and Thoughts to each other, the chief means of all our converſe and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe each with other: but lying alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42669:97"/> fruſtrates and diſappoints the ends of Speech: In ſtead of acquainting others with our mind and thoughts, it deceives and miſinforms them; and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is more ſociable than untrue ſpeech. We deſire other men ſhould ſpeak the truth to us, to inform and ſatisfie, and not to cheat and delude us; and therefore we are obliged our ſelves to ſpeak the truth, and not to lie unto others.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The ſame Rule trains us up to all Juſtice in Buying and Selling, ſo that the Tradeſman ſhall neither by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-price, below what the reſt of his Occupation can live by, gain away their Cuſtom from them, nor yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the price of any Commodity above the value of it, that I mean for which it may be ſold, and which is the ordinary Rate of it; ſo that the Buyer ſhall have a valuable matter for the Money which he gives, and the Seller alſo a valuable Price for that which he parts with, but neither of them make their Gains out of each others Loſſes. Every honeſt man would ſo buy as the Seller might live by him, and have a moderate and ratable conſideration for
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42669:97"/> his Art, and Pains, and Hazards; and every one that ſells juſtly can deſire no more.</p>
               <p>The Rule of Juſtice in all Commerce and Traffick in the World is <hi>aequalitas accepti &amp; redditi,</hi> an equality of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between what is received and what is returned, that there be a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble given for a valuable, which cannot be ſecured more effectually than by the Rule we are upon; The Buyer to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf in the Sellers place, and the Seller again in the Buyers, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of circumſtances allowed for. The one is to ſell, not as himſelf buys, for he cannot live without ſome gains; but as he would reaſonably deſire to buy were he in his Cuſtomers room, <hi>i. e.</hi> for moderate and conſcionable gains: And the Buyer again ſhould willingly give thoſe moderate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable Allowances which the thing he purchaſeth, rated together with the Pains, and Hazard, and Art of the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is valuable for; <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as were he himſelf in the Sellers room he would deſire from another.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The ſame Rule obligeth us to all Juſtice in the performance of our
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42669:98"/> Words, Promiſes, Covenants, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, or Oaths. He that promiſeth to another (be it by word of mouth or writing, it matters not) conveys away a Right and Title unto that which he promiſeth; but is deeper ſtill engaged to the performance, if he have called God in as a Witneſs to the Contract and Promiſe made by him. The good mans character is,<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.4.</note> that <q>though he ſweareth to his own hurt and damage, he changeth not:</q> So regardful is he of thoſe Promiſes he hath ſealed by Oath, that he will perform them, though it be to his own prejudice. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this Rule will train us up to make Conſcience of the ſame, to keep our Promiſes, to perform our Covenants, to make good our Words and Oathes; for this we deſire and expect from other men: we build upon their Words, we truſt to and rely on their Engagements, Bonds, and Covenants; we look they ſhould ſtand to their Agreements; we brand it for the higheſt injury and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, for any that have given us the greateſt ſecurity upon earth, I mean an Oath, to ſhew themſelves perſidious and perjured together. But 'tis a ſhame to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42669:98"/> ſpeak how much the Chriſtian World degenerates in this Point: Famous was the inſtance of that eminent Heathen the <hi>Roman Regulus,</hi> who being taken Priſoner of his Enemies the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and obtaining leave of them to go home to <hi>Rome,</hi> to treat with the Senate for a Commutation, or exchange of Captives, with promiſe if he ſped not, to return again; firſt gave weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the Senate to diſſwade them from the Commutation, and then return'd back himſelf unto cruel uſage, rather than he would falſifie and violate his Faith and Promiſe.— But we muſt renew the Pſalmiſts complaint,<note place="margin">Pſal. 12.1, 2.</note> 
                  <q>Help Lord, for the godly man ceaſeth, the faithful fail from among the Children of men; they ſpeak vanity every one with his Neighbour, with flattering lips and with a double heart do they ſpeak.</q>— They lie in their hearts, when they promiſe, and after their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made lie again to men in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; they eſteem their words but as wind, and their Covenants in writing little more than ſcribbled Papers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are not concerned. In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting of their Debts from others they
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42669:99"/> are like the Servant in the Parable, <q>who finding his fellow-ſervant that ought him an hundred pence,<note place="margin">S. Mat. 18.</note> laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, ſaying, Pay me what thou oweſt,</q> deſpiſing his ſubmiſſion, ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his entreaties, ſtopping his ears to his Requeſts, uſing no forbearance, but caſting him forthwith into Priſon till he ſhould pay the Debt.— But when they ſhould come to diſcharge their own to others, good words at beſt are their preſent payment, <q>Sir, have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with me, and I will pay you all;</q> Forbearance is the thing they intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally drive at, but the payment of all goes ſlowly on. Now, did men as they would be done by, they would not only in caſes of apparent neceſſity forbear others upon their requeſts, as themſelves in the like caſes would deſire to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born; but would as faithfully and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably pay their Debts to others, as they deſire other men ſhould diſcharge theirs to themſelves. Every one would look upon the violation of his own Word, Promiſe, or Oath, with as evil and cenſorious an eye, as he doth on the unfaithfulneſs of others.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:42669:99"/>
               <p>Here let me drop a Remarque upon the notorious injuſtice of ſuch who have plighted their Faith to each other in the ſolemn Promiſes and Precontracts of Matrimony. For either of them to fail, without a mutual Releaſe, is an injury the Heathens would bluſh at: And they need no more to excite them to be honeſt and punctual each with other, than the conſideration of what the one Party expects and deſires from the other. How ill would he that breaks his Faith have taken it, ſhould ſhe have broken hers firſt? And the ſame may be ſaid of the Woman. Beſides that in this caſe the injury is valuable not only according to the prejudice reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this unfaithfulneſs, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that degree of affection which the Party is engaged in with whom the Faith is broken.—To this I will yet add one other. I would to God it were eſpecially laid to heart by men, how indiſpenſibly they ſtand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to their Sovereign by vertue of the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance ſworn by them; and that all Officers would impartially conſider how ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are engaged by the reſpective
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42669:100"/> Oaths taken by them at their entrance upon their Offices, and then, I am ſure, a diſcharge of the ſame would be look'd upon as an undeniable Branch of Juſtice, which they would as readily ſet themſelves about, as they require and expect any others ſhould do about the performance of what they ſwear to. But becauſe of the monſtrous breach of Oaths, this horrid diſhoneſty, injuſtice, and perjury, the Land mourneth.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) The ſame Rule teacheth us to be true and faithful in all our Truſts; for that we deſire and expect from others our ſelves. Now,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Every mans Calling and Office is his Truſt. We expect men ſhould be both skilful and faithful in their Callings and Imployments; and therefore ſuch ſhould we approve our ſelves to be.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) He that leaves another a pledge of his Fidelity in the performance of his Contract, as a Truſt to be returned again upon the performance, may after that performance challenge the ſame in the nature of a <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> to be rendred and reſtored again without hurt or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing; for thus we expect other men ſhould deal with us.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:42669:100"/>(3.) He that commits his Secrets to another to be concealed, admits him to a Truſt which he is not to violate. "Diſcover not the ſecret of another,<note place="margin">Prov. 25.9.</note> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> This diſcloſing of Secrets, however common it be in the babbling Age wherein we live, is the higheſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and injury to Friendſhip imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the bane of Amity, and no man is willing to be ſerved ſo himſelf. 'Tis ſuppoſed always, that nothing is to be communicated by way of Secret, which tends to Treaſon and Conſpiracy; for in this caſe to conceal is to partake of the Guilt, and become a Partner in the Iniquity.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) The Executors and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators of the Goods of the Deceaſed have a great Truſt lying upon them, by vertue of the Will of the Deceaſed; and the Will of the Deceaſed hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been eſteemed a moſt ſacred Band of Fidelity. The laſt Truſt we can leave with any, is the Execution of our Will and Pleaſure when we are gone hence; and though the Parties that have left the Truſt are in no capacity, it may be, of taking cognizance of the performance, yet we may reckon with our ſelves, that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42669:101"/> God takes ſo much the more notice of it, and will exact ſo much a ſtricter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at the hands of thoſe who are concerned: And they who preſume to rob the Dead, or thwart their laſt Will and Pleaſure, ſhould, methinks, have the Ghoſts of their departed Friends continually haunting of their Phanſies, and upbraiding them with their inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, unfaithfulneſs, and breach of truſt? Who would be thus dealt with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Nay, it would add to the diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of our Spirits at our deceaſe did we not confidently rely upon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of others in the obſerving of our laſt Appointments.</p>
               <p>Of the ſame nature are Feoffees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Conveyance of Lands unto Pious uſes; only their injuſtice is the more aggravated by the injury they do the Poor, and their impiety towards God, as well as their contempt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs to the Wills of the Dead.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) To theſe might be added Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Guardians, who are intruſted with the Perſons and Eſtates of others during their Minority. Governors and Protectors in like manner with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Prince; and they who become
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42669:101"/> Sponſors and Sureties to the Church at the Baptizing of Infants, to ſee to their Inſtruction and Education in order to a Vertuous and Chriſtian Life.</p>
               <p>The violation and breach of Truſts is an inexcuſable Branch of Injuſtice, which we our ſelves would be moſt ready to exclaim againſt in others; and therefore Fidelity in every Truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us, is a piece of Juſtice we are by this Rule to charge our ſelves withal.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to mention no more, 'Tis a point of Juſtice to render Tribute and Cuſtom to our Governours, in order to their Honourable Maintenance, and for the defraying of the great Expences of their Place, and the ſupplies of the emergent neceſſities of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to render Tribute and Cuſtom, as well as Fear, Honour, and Obedience; and this we ſhould expect and look for our ſelves, were we in their room.</p>
               <p>But this may poſſibly be referr'd to the peformance of our Contracts and Oaths, or the payment of our Debts, or that Obedience I ſpake before of as due to our Superiors: And therefore I will add no more of it.</p>

               <p>SEventhly, To draw towards a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, We are by this Rule obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to all the acts of Love and Charity unto others; &amp; this I ſhall demonſtrate, as I have done the foregoing, by ſeveral Inſtances that are moſt properly to be referr'd unto, and ranked under this Head. And,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) I will begin with the common act of Love and Charity, I mean, Pity and compaſſion towards, ſympathy and fellow-feeling with the afflicted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed; a due conſideration of, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected with the ſufferings and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of others.<note place="margin">Heb. 13.3.</note> 
                  <q>Remember them who are in bonds, ſaith the Apoſtle, as bound with them; and them which ſuffer adverſity, as being your ſelves alſo in the body;</q> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> as being your ſelves Members of the ſame Body, and dwelling in like manner in a Body ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the very ſame evils and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: So remember them therefore in their bonds and adverſity, as you would deſire your ſelves in a like caſe to be remembred. 'Tis natural for us in the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42669:102"/> time of affliction to covet and be pleaſed with the pity and commiſeration of others; the yearning of their bowels and expreſſion of their compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, is as a Cordial to our ſpirits, and eaſeth us in a great meaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of our burden: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, 'tis a vexation and trouble, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beyond other troubles, not to be regarded and ſympathized with.

               <p>The only doubt to be reſolved further is, Whether it exact our love alſo to our Enemies? For that you know is the Goſpel-Command, That we ſhould love our Enemies; that is an Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on S. <hi>Paul</hi> takes out of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 
                  <q>If thine enemy hunger feed him,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.20. Prov. 25.21.</note> if he thirſt give him drink:</q> That was a Precept alſo in the Law,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.4, 5.</note> 
                  <q>to bring back an enemies ox going aſtray, and to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42669:112"/> help up his aſs lying under a burthen.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now many are ſo nobly reſolved, as we are apt to ſpeak, that they diſdain to receive a Courteſie from an Enemy; they will rather ſtarve, than be fed by an Enemy; rather die, than be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by an Enemy. It may therefore ſeem queſtionable whether this Rule will oblige to Love, and Goodneſs, and Charity towards an Enemy, doing to him as we would our ſelves receive from him.</p>
               <p>But the reſolution is eaſie and clear enough: For who doth not commend the nobleneſs and generoſity of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies kindneſs? who doth not praiſe and extol this in an Enemy? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs adjudge himſelf obliged to imitate what he admires the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and lovelineſs of. To do good to others, as Men, is good and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in it ſelf; and ſo to whomſoever the good be done, friend or foe: But to do good to ones Enemy heightens the degrees of Charity; for if it be <q>a more bleſſed thing to give than to receive,</q> according to our Saviours Axiom, our Reaſon muſt needs infer, that it is ſtill the more bleſſed and praiſe-worthy
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42669:112"/> to do good to thoſe from whom we have received evil our ſelves.—And as for what was principal in the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the unwillingneſs of ſome to receive kindneſſes from their Enemies, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion not but ſome deep degrees of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and extremity would quickly tame and ſubdue that pride and haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Spirits.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Rule of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (as Reverend Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> well obſerves) is, That we do that for <hi>every</hi> man, which we would have <hi>any</hi> man do for us; and not only that to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> man, which we expect from them alone.</p>
               <p>Nor yet merely ſo; but, (as was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Explication) That we do that to every man, according to our Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which we deſire to receive our ſelves at <hi>God's</hi> hands; and wo were our caſe, if he had not loved us whilſt we were <hi>Enemies;</hi> loved us ſo then, as to preſerve us in our Being till by his Grace we were made friends, and ſo admitted unto greater Bleſſings.—It is not therefore to be wondred that S. <hi>Luke</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. Luke 6.</note> placeth this Golden Rule amidſt the other Commands of Love (as I ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in the beginning) and that Love
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42669:113"/> to Enemies, whereby we may become <q>merciful, as our Father alſo is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And thus now, as briefly as the copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of ſuch a Subject would well allow, I have run through the chief Heads of thoſe Vertues we are engaged by this Rule to be zealous followers of; and intimated by the way thoſe contrary Vices we are to ſhun and abhor: And, I think, I may well conclude this Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s heap of Univerſals, <q>Finally,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.8.</note> Brethren, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt or venerable, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are of good report, if there be any vertue, and if there be any praiſe, think of theſe things.</q>

                  <hi>haec legis va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>túmque ſumma;</hi> This is that which the Law and Prophets teach, and this is the ſum of the Law and Prophets. This Rule is eſtabliſhed by the Authority of the Law and the Prophets, and it is in it ſelf a fruitful Epitome of the ſeveral Precepts delivered in the Law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. <hi>Quae in illâ aut ab iſtis dicta;</hi> The things contained in the Law, or ſpoken by the Prophets, are ſummarily compriſed in this Saying.</p>
               <p>The Law and the Prophets ſtand for all the Old Teſtament, for which alſo ſometimes is put <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: Thus S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour,<note place="margin">S.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42669:114"/> of them,<note place="margin">S. Luke 16.29.</note>

                  </q> The Scribes and Phariſees had much in their mouths the Law and the Prophets; the Law and the Prophets were read daily in their Synagogues:<note place="margin">Act. 13.15.</note> and yet ſo blind were they in their practice, as to overlook that which was moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Law and the Prophets. The better therefore to infore this excellent Rule of Life, our Bleſſed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tells his Diſciples, That this is the Law and the Prophets: <hi>i. e.</hi> This (1.) is that which they undeniably call for: This is indeed (2.) the ſum of that Duty they require: And this (3.) they put a ſpecial Emphaſis upon, above all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and ceremonial Obſervances what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p>Under this three-fold Gloſs I ſhall endeavour to give you an account of our Bleſſed Saviours Argument, <q>For this is the Law and the Prophets.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, This is that which the Law and the Prophets do unqueſtionably and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42669:114"/> undeniably call for. The foundations and grounds of this Rule are there clearly expreſſed; the Branches to which it extends ſelf are there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and enjoyned. <hi>This Rule hath the Authority of the Holy Scriptures to back and enforce it.</hi> So far is Chriſt from diſparaging the Law and Prophets, that he eſtabliſeth his Precepts by them:<note place="margin">S. Mat. 5.17.</note> 
                  <q>Think not, ſaith he, that I am come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfil;</q> 
                  <hi>q. d.</hi> I came not to abrogate or take away the binding power of the Law and Prophets, but my ſelf to fulfil what they preſcribed; and not only to injoyn it upon my Diſciples, but to fill up and explain the true ſenſe and meaning of that in my Miniſtry, which was more darkly ſhadowed and adumbrated only by them. The Jewiſh Laws are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſtinguiſhed into Moral, Judicial, and Ceremonial.</p>
               <p>The Moral Law is the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture revived, the Law leaning on eternal and never-failing Principle and Rules of Equity: And this is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtroyed by Chriſt, that he hath ratified and improved it.</p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:42669:115"/>
               <p>The Judicial or Civil Law is that which reſpecteth them as a particular State, Body, and Society, ſeparate and diſtinct from the reſt of the World; this ſtood in force ſo long as their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth and Government remained: but appertaining unto them in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, cannot reaſonably be thought to oblige others, further than the natural and real equity of its Precepts agrees with the Circumſtances of other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.</p>
               <p>The Ceremonial or Eccleſiaſtical Law is that which preſcribes the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Rites and Ceremonies of their Church, which were but Types and Shadows of ſomething more perfect to ſucceed them; and Types and Shadows do of their own accord ceaſe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, when the Subſtance or Body is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced: So that the nature of theſe Laws ſet a bound and limit to their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging Power; and Chriſt hath not ſo much diſſolved and deſtroyed, as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled them.</p>
               <p>The Law and Prophets are as authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and divine as ever, and as fit to oblige us to thoſe Laws, which are built on eternal Principles of Equity;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42669:115"/> and ſo extend themſelves as really to us, as ever they did to the Jews. But as for thoſe other Laws which reſpected their peculiar Polity in Church and State, and ſo were for a certain People, Place, and Time, they are to have their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Power determined according to thoſe mutable Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>We muſt reverence and receive the Holy Scriptures as well of the Old as the New Teſtament, for the infallible Word of God, ſpeaking to us with a Divine Authority, and commanding both our belief and obedience. <hi>Si ſcire vis quid tenendum ſit</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salvian</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well,<note place="margin">Salvian. l. 3.</note> ſpeaking particularly of providence) <hi>habes ſacras literas: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecta ratio eſt hoc tenere quod legeris;</hi> If thou wouldeſt know what is to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and embraced, thou haſt the Holy Writings for thy direction; and 'tis perfect reaſon to hold and embrace that which thou ſhalt there read. <hi>Plus eſt Deus quam omnis humana ratio: humana dicta argumentis ac teſtibus egent, Dei autem ſermo ipſe ſibi teſtis eſt; quia ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe eſt quicquid incorrupta veritas loqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur incorruptum ſit teſtimonium veritatis;</hi> God is more to thee than all Humane

               <p>A Scripture ſhould be more to us than any Reaſon; provided only, that we miſtake it not, that we miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it not, that we miſapply it not: for we can have no greater confirmation than Divine Authority. We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed leſt at any time we prove irreverent Rejecters of the Word of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42669:117"/> God, or any thing propounded to us out of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> prefers the voice of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets before the teſtimony of one ariſing purpoſely from the dead, for the warning of the living.<note place="margin">S. Luk. 16.31.</note> 
                  <q>If they hear not <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, ſaith he, neither will they be perſwaded though one aroſe from the dead.</q> But if once the Law and the Prophets, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Prophets find credit, the Old Teſtament will uſher in the belief of the New, as well as the New confirm and ſtrengthen the belief of the Old. <q>Had you believed <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayings,<note place="margin">S. John 5.46.</note> you would have believed me, ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for he wrote of me.</q> Why! what wrote he of Chriſt? This expreſly, <q>God ſhall raiſe up unto thee a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet like unto me,<note place="margin">Deut. 18.15.</note> of thy Brethren, according to thy deſire; and I will put my words into his mouth, and whoſoever will not hearken unto the words which he ſhall ſpeak in my Name, I will require it of him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I urge the venerable eſtimation and reception of the Holy Scriptures, from the force of our Bleſſed Saviour's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <q>For this is the Law and the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42669:117"/> Prophets.</q> He backs his Golden Rule and Precept with that Divine and Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Authority, which whoever are found deſpiſers and contemners of, will be ſentenced as rejecters of the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Commands of God himſelf; for the Holy Scripture is no other than his Voice, who hath the moſt abſolute Authority over both our Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And were there no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Account to be given of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Chriſts, it were abundant proof, That it is Gods peremptory Command, made known in the Law and Prophets.

               </p>
               <p>'Tis reaſonable, all men being Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that the chiefeſt Good have our chiefeſt love and delight; that Truth it ſelf have our firm belief; that Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence have our chiefeſt fear and truſt;

               <p>The Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> argues upon this foundation:<note place="margin">Mal. 1.6, 8, 14.

And then he concludes, But curſed be the deceiver, which hath in his Flock a Male, but vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſacrificeth to the Lord a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt thing; for I am a great King, ſaith the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>This Rule then will plainly oblige us to hate all hypocriſie and double dealing towards God, which we abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in men towards our ſelves; and to be ſincere and upright, before him eſpecially, to whoſe all-ſeeing eye all things are diſſected, naked, and open.</p>

               <p>And then, ſince God is before-hand with us in doing of us good, and we are not able to make him any amends, to benefit him by ought we do, we muſt needs be trained up to all poſſible ways of grateful acknowledgment, thankſgiving and praiſe, for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, chearfulneſs in his Service, and

               <p>Thirdly, One Gloſs more may yet be added. This is the Law and the Prophets; <hi>i. e.</hi> This Rule of Moral and Eternal Righteouſneſs is that which they principally urge, and in reference
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42669:123"/> unto which, in compare with which, they ſlight and undervalue all Rites and Ceremonies of Religion, all External Devotions and Performances whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves. Thus whereas the queſtion was propoſed in the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> 
                  <q>Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord,<note place="margin">verſ. 6, 7.</note> and bow my ſelf before the High God?
